<p>A Notification defines how users will be notified when a <a href="recommendation-alert.html">Recommendation Alert</a> occurs. A Recommendation Alert occurs when a <a href="rule.html">Rule</a> condition is met and triggers the Alert to happen. Notifications are set for a recommendation Rule. Each Rule can have multiple Notifications, each based on different conditions that can trigger an Alert.</p>
<p>You can add a new Notification by pressing the <em>plus</em> button on the top right of the notifications.</p>

<h2 id="triggers">Triggers</h2>
<p>Notifications have several triggers. When they happen, will notify everyone who is <a href="notification.html#subscribe">subscribed</a> to the notification. The triggers are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="new-recommendation">New Recommendation</h3>
<p>When &quot;<strong>Send Recommendation when a new recommendation is generated</strong>&quot; is checked, subscribers will be notified when a new Recommendation Alert is created from the same Rule.</p>
<h3 id="status-change">Status Change</h3>
<p>When &quot;<strong>Resolved</strong>&quot; is checked, subscribers will be notified when a Recommendation Alert created by the same Rule is resolved.</p>
<p>When &quot;<strong>False Positive</strong>&quot; is checked, subscribers will be notified when a Recommendation Alert created by the same Rule is marked as False Positive.</p>
<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>
<p>When &quot;<strong>Send notification when notes are added to a recommendation</strong>&quot; is checked, subscribers will be notified when Notes are added or changed on a Recommendation Alert created by the same Rule.</p>
<h3 id="time-pending">Time Pending</h3>
<p>When &quot;<strong>Send a notification after</strong>&quot; is checked, subscribers will be notified the specified amount of time after a Recommendation Alert is created from the same Rule if the Alert has not been resolved.</p>
<p>When &quot;<strong>And repeat notification</strong>&quot; is checked, subscribers will be notified the specified number of times, waiting the specified amount of time between each notification, if a Recommendation Alert has still not been resolved.</p>
<p>For example, in the image below, subscribed users will be notified once every hour for two hours that a Recommendation Alert has not been created and hasn't been resolved.</p>

<h2 id="channels">Channels</h2>
<h3 id="email">Email</h3>
<p>When a trigger occurs, everyone who has subscribed and has entered a correct email address in their profile will receive an email.</p>
<h3 id="sms">SMS</h3>
<p>When a trigger occurs, everyone who has subscribed and has entered a correct mobile phone number (in international format) in their profile will receive an email.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>The email and mobile number that you use to receive notifications can be changed when <a href="../../administration/users/profile.html">updating the user settings</a>.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="notification-template">Notification Template</h2>
<p>When a <a href="recommendation-alert.html">Recommendation Alert</a> is triggered by a critical event, the user can receive a notification via text message or email. The notification contains a message that notifies the user of the Recommendation Alert. You can choose to create a custom message template for when a notification is triggered, or use a default template provided.</p>

</div>
<h2 id="subscribe">Subscribe</h2>
<p>Notification Settings are available only if the user has run access.</p>
<p>Notification Settings are managed individually by each User. To manage your subscriptions, hover over your user profile in the top-right of the page in App Designer, and click &quot;Notification Settings&quot;.</p>
<p>By default, you will not be subscribed to any Notifications. You can subscribe to an individual Notification, Rule, Recommendation, or Category by checking it in the list and saving.</p>
<p>If an item is checked, you are subscribed to all Notifications — as well as Notifications that may be created in the future — within the item, and you will be notified when Notifications are triggered.</p>
