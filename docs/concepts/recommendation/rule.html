<p>A Rule defines the conditions for triggering a <a href="recommendation-alert.html">Recommendation Alert</a> and what the created Recommendation Alert should look like. Multiple Rules can also be grouped into one <a href="index.html">Recommendation</a>.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/image-20.png" alt="Rule Configuration"></p>
<h2 id="rule-logic">Rule Logic</h2>
<p>Data sent from the selected Data Stream is passed through the Rule Logic and if the conditions created are met by the data, a new Recommendation Alert will be created.</p>
<p>You can add new conditions or groups by clicking the + button. Groups can be nested within each other to create advanced logic. In an &quot;And&quot; group, all the conditions must be true, and in an &quot;Or&quot; group, only one of the conditions must be true to trigger an Alert.</p>
<p>As an example, in the following Rule Logic, both of the following must be true to trigger an Alert:</p>
<ul>
<li>Average must be greater than 50,</li>
<li>And V1, V2, or V3 must be greater than 60.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="alert-headline--description">Alert Headline &amp; Description</h2>
<p>This refers to the headline and description that the Recommendation Alert will be created with. Any tag (starting with @) will be replaced with the value output from the Data Stream.</p>
<h2 id="alert-ranking">Alert Ranking</h2>
<p>The priority level that the Recommendation Alert will be created with. Priority level determines the order in which the Alerts will be displayed.</p>
<h2 id="impact-metric">Impact Metric</h2>
<p>The measurable impact of the business event detected by the Recommendation Rule. This will be shown on Alerts in the Recommendation Block in App Pages.</p>
<h2 id="enable-form">Enable Form</h2>
<p>A flag that determines whether the Recommendation Alert will be created with a <a href="form.html">Form</a>.</p>
<h2 id="select-form">Select Form</h2>
<p>The <a href="form.html">Form </a>that the Recommendation Alert will be created with.</p>
<h2 id="form-version">Form Version</h2>
<p>The <a href="../version.html">Version</a> of the <a href="form.html">Form</a> that the Recommendation Alert will be created with.</p>
<h2 id="additional-recommendation-management-column">Additional Recommendation Management Column</h2>
<p>An additional column in the Recommendation Alerts grid. Any tag (starting with @) will be replaced with the value entered in the corresponding field in the Form.</p>
<h2 id="resolution">Resolution</h2>
<p>Resolution determines whether new data from the Data Stream will automatically resolve the Recommendation Alert if the Rule Logic is no longer true.</p>
<p><strong>Manual Resolution:</strong> A user must manually resolve each Recommendation.</p>
<p><strong>Automatic Resolution:</strong> Recommendation auto resolves when trigger conditions are no longer true. This may impact performance, as it might continuously trigger and resolve a large number of Recommendations at a time if the data fluctuates frequently.</p>
<h2 id="recurrence">Recurrence</h2>
<p>Recurrence determines whether new data from the Data Stream will create new Recommendation Alerts if a Pending Recommendation Alert already exists and the Rule Logic is true.</p>
<p>If the conditions created by the Rule Logic are met by the data, and if Recurrence is set to All Occurrences or First Occurrence and no Pending Alert exists, a new Recommendation Alert will be created.</p>
<p><strong>First Occurrence:</strong> The current recommendation must be resolved before others can be triggered for the same rule.</p>
<p><strong>All Occurrences:</strong> A new recommendation will be triggered every time the rule conditions are true.</p>
<p>Recurrence will be disabled and be considered to be the <strong>First Occurrence</strong> if the Recommendation has <strong>Execution Order</strong> enabled.</p>
<h2 id="log-data-on">Log Data On</h2>
<p>Determines whether new data from the Data Stream will log new data in the Event Data grid if the Rule Logic is true.</p>
<p><strong>First Occurrence:</strong> Current recommendation will only log data on the first occurrence.</p>
<p><strong>All Occurrences:</strong> New alert data will be triggered every time the rule conditions are true.</p>
<h2 id="triage-instructions">Triage Instructions</h2>
<p>Instructions to help whoever is resolving the Recommendation Alert.</p>
<p><em>Enable Triage Instructions</em> is a flag that determines whether the Recommendation Alert will be created with Triage Instructions.</p>
<h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>
<p>A list of links on the Recommendation Alert to help whoever is resolving the Recommendation Alert.</p>
<p><em>Enable Resources</em> is a flag that determines whether the Recommendation Alert will be created with Resources.</p>
<h2 id="notifications">Notifications</h2>
<p>This refers to the list of <a href="notification.html">Notifications </a>that will be sent out to everyone who is subscribed.</p>
<h2 id="view-related-alerts">View Related Alerts</h2>
<p>You can view Alerts that are directly related to a Rule. To do this, open the Rule's page and click on <em>Alerts</em> at the top. This will take you directly to the Alerts list table, which will be filtered to only display the Alerts related to the specific rule you are viewing.</p>
