<h2 id="benefits-of-bpm-v-10-1">Benefits of BPM v 1.0</h2>
<p>Posted on <a href="https://xmpro.com/benefits-of-bpm-v-1-0/">January 28, 2011</a> by <a href="https://xmpro.com/author/pietervs/">Pieter van Schalkwyk</a></p>
<p>BPM Benefits v 2.0 will be addressed in a follow up post and revolves around the additional benefits gained from a dynamic BPM approach and the value of getting better at getting work done. For now we will list the benefits from a basic BPM implementation or project.</p>
<p><br>
The traditional benefits of BPM (v 1.0) are primarily focused around:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reducing Cost</li>
<li>Improving Revenue or Customer Service</li>
<li>Managing Risks and Ensuring Compliance</li>
<li>Creating Competitive Advantage</li>
<li>Enabling Innovation and Process Improvement</li>
</ol>
<p>The additional (lower level) benefits of electronic forms processesing includes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Improved throughput (productivity)</li>
<li>Removing unnecessary manual controls and steps (efficiency)</li>
<li>Improve accuracy and repeatability (quality)</li>
<li>Improve visibility, decision trails and process logging (customer service and governance)</li>
<li>Improve monitoring and load planning (operational efficiency and improvements)</li>
<li>More options for re-location, hosted services, outsourcing (organisational flexibility)</li>
</ol>
<p>BPM can be done without systems but the November 2008 Aberdeen Research Report – BPM and Beyond : The Human Factor of Process Management – reports that Best in Class organisations that have implemented BPM systems achieved a 53% improvement in process consistency, compared to a 13% improvement for the Industry Average and a 13% decline for Laggards.</p>
<p><a href="http://au.linkedin.com/in/rogertregear">Roger Tregear</a> at Leonardo Consulting provides an expanded version of these v 1.0 benefits:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reduce costs, remove waste. Why waste time and resources doing unnecessary things or doing necessary things the hard way?</li>
<li>Avoid opportunity losses. Deeper understanding of processes and their relationships reduces the chance of missed opportunities.</li>
<li>Improve customer service (value delivery). Business processes are the only way any organization can deliver value to its customers.</li>
<li>Increase organisational agility. Change demands understanding. Big change and fast change demand intimate understanding.</li>
<li>Improve risk management. The more you understand a process the better you can predict and protect its weaknesses.</li>
<li>Improve compliance management. Effective ongoing compliance management is an automatic consequence of a managed business process architecture.</li>
<li>Document processes. Simply documenting a process provides new understanding and reference material for training and review.</li>
<li>Process consistency. Documenting how a process work provides a clear guideline for how that same process should be executed everywhere in the organisation.</li>
<li>Protect intellectual capital. The fragile and portable heads of key staff members is not a good place to store an organisation’s intellectual capital.</li>
<li>Support contingency planning. Process-based management focuses the development of contingency processes on the things that will matter in a crisis.</li>
<li>Improve strategy execution. Business processes are the way in which every organisation executes it’s strategy.</li>
<li>Reduce complexity. Unnecessary complexity in any aspect of an organisation is a handicap to optimum performance.</li>
<li>Improve IT outcomes. The purpose of IT systems is to support the execution of business processes. How can that happen without shared process understanding?</li>
<li>Improve effective performance measurement. A process-based management approach allows us to measure the full set of things that really matter.</li>
<li>Support staff to achieve success. If “people are our most important asset”, why do we so often frustrate them with broken processes.</li>
</ol>
<p>Roger also has an interesting way to describe what BPM is (while we are on the subject):</p>
<ol>
<li>Organisations exist to deliver value to customers and stakeholders. That’s strategy.</li>
<li>They do this via a series of coordinated activities across a number of functional elements of the organisation. That’s a process.</li>
<li>It makes sense to optimise these processes so that they satisfy the requirements of customers and other stakeholders. That’s process improvement.</li>
<li>Taking a coordinated view of the performance of the processes by which an organisation delivers value, optimises performance. That’s process management.</li>
<li>Process management allows organisations to focus on processes that create the market differentiation described by the strategy. That’s execution.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is not an exhaustive list or explanation of the benefits but a good conversation starter on how BPM can have significant impact in your organisation.</p>
