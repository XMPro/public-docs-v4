<h4 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h4>
<p>In recent years, the word “Digital Twin” has become quite a buzzword. Many industries have concluded that the future of operational excellence will be dictated by successful implementation of a composable digital twin strategy.</p>
<p>A successful composable digital twin strategy will not only give COOs a real-time view of assets, processes, and workflows but also help to create a common operating picture at the strategic, tactical, and operational level.</p>
<p>The word “Common Operating Picture” is a military term for a single identical display of relevant (operational) information (e.g. position of own troops and enemy troops, position and status of important infrastructure such as bridges, roads, etc.) shared by more than one command. A <strong>COP</strong> facilitates collaborative planning and combined execution and assists all echelons to achieve <em>situational awareness</em>.</p>
<p>Business leaders have realised that through an effective Digital Twin strategy, they can create a real-time COP that helps them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid being blindsided by critical operational events</li>
<li>Minimise asset down-time</li>
<li>Increase asset output and lifespan.</li>
<li>Improve operational safety &amp; security</li>
<li>Synchronize communication at a strategic, tactical and operational level</li>
</ul>
<p>Most industries including mining, oil &amp; gas, natural resources, and manufacturing are still in the very early stages of technology adoption – few know where to start, or exactly what a composable digital twin strategy looks like.</p>
<h4 id="what-is-a-digital-twin">What is A digital Twin?</h4>
<p>According to the Digital Twin Consortium – Digital Twins are virtual representations of real-world entities and processes, synchronized at a specified frequency and fidelity. Digital twins use real-time and historical data to represent the past and present and simulate predicted futures.</p>
<ul>
<li>Digital twin systems transform business by accelerating holistic understanding, optimal decision-making, and effective action.</li>
<li>Digital twins use real-time and historical data to represent the past and present and simulate predicted futures.</li>
<li>Digital twins are motivated by outcomes, tailored to use cases, powered by integration, built on data, guided by domain knowledge, and implemented in IT/OT systems.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://xmpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/2022-10-17_12-45-24-1024x576.png" alt=""></p>
<h4 id="digital-twin-example--smart-manufacturing">Digital Twin Example : Smart Manufacturing</h4>
<p>In this example, real-time data is used for anomaly detection in a robotic arm.</p>
<h4 id="define-the-problem--scope">Define The Problem &amp; Scope</h4>
<p>Before you can start to think about building a Digital Twin, you will firstly need to properly define the problem that you are trying to solve, including the scope, severity, and impact.</p>
<p>Many companies have fallen into the trap of building a Digital Twin without a proper problem and scope definition – this is simply planning to fail as the Digital Twin will lack the sufficient capabilities to solve the required business problem.</p>
<p>You will also need to think about how the ROI of your digital twin can be measured and benchmarked as it will be vital for the justification of the expansion of your business’ Digital Twin strategy, which should culminate in a real-time Common Operating Picture.</p>
<h4 id="how-to-build-a-digital-twin">How to Build A Digital Twin</h4>
<p>The very first step in building a digital twin is the same as with building anything – you need to make sure you have the right tools!</p>
<p>You wouldn’t build a house without making sure you have the right tools ready to get the job done, the same is true with digital twins.</p>
<p>Many companies jump in headfirst, trying to build their digital twin through an in-house point solution. This is a bit like trying to build a house by hand… In addition to spending over 50% of project budget on integration capability, there are a few critical issues with this approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>Point solutions are usually designed with only <strong>one use case</strong> in mind.</li>
<li>Point solutions are usually not interoperable or scalable.</li>
<li>Point solutions are resource intensive, and do not guarantee success.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>“Okay, so point solutions won’t do for Digital Twins, what are the right tools that I need to build  a Digital Twin strategy for my business?”</strong></p>
<p>The key to building an effective Digital Twin strategy is found in the word “composability”</p>
<h4 id="using-a-composable-approach-to-digital-twins">USING A COMPOSABLE APPROACH TO DIGITAL TWINS</h4>
<p><img src="https://xmpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Composable-Digital-Twin-Blocks-1024x530.png" alt=""><img src="https://xmpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Built-Composable-Digital-Twin-Blocks-1024x530.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Composable Digital Twins is an application development approach for Digital Twins that is based on an agile, composable enterprise architectural pattern.</p>
<p>Using a composable approach to building digital twins is often a neglected topic, but is vital to the scalability of digital twin solutions within an organization. Composable digital twin solutions can be reused within new applications utilizing a “plug and play” fashion. It is the key ingredient to cementing competitive advantage over competitors.</p>
<p>Most businesses in asset-intensive industries are held hostage to large scale monolithic technology support platforms such as complex ERP’s and CRM. The only way a digital twin strategy can be implemented at scale is through composable digital twins that easily integrates across the board.</p>
<p>Composable Digital Twins focus on faster time to value, service-based orchestration, and reusing packaged business capabilities to develop and adapt highly scalable industrial applications for complex systems​.</p>
<h4 id="digital-twin-capabilities-framework">DIGITAL TWIN CAPABILITIES FRAMEWORK</h4>
<p>Digital twins can be composed to solve a plethora of business use cases using packaged business capabilities.</p>
<p>The Digital Twin Consortium defines these capabilities in 6 different categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data Services</li>
<li>Integration</li>
<li>Intelligence</li>
<li>UX</li>
<li>Management</li>
<li>Trustworthiness</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="the-5-quick-wins">The 5 quick wins</h4>
<p>At XMPro, we recommend that businesses identify the top 5 “quick wins” where initial Digital Twin development can create quick time-to-value, which in turn justifies the expansion of the digital twin environment within the organisation.</p>
<p>In order to do this, we use the XMPro prioritization matrix to assesses both business impact and technical readiness of a Digital Twin project. We go into more depth regarding this prioritization matrix in our article “Lean Digital Twin : Part 2” – <a href="https://xmpro.com/lean-digital-twin-part-2/">read more…</a></p>
<h4 id="enable-your-subject-matter-experts">ENABLE YOUR SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS</h4>
<p>Okay, so you have identified your first 5 “quick wins” where digital twins can make a real difference, the next step is to involve your subject matter experts in the solution design process. Your SME’s understand the problem better than anyone else, and will be the most effective at designing a digital twin solution to address it. XMPro’s No Code Digital Twin Composition Platform allows SME’s to easily compose their own digital twin solutions using blueprints and templates for quick time-to-value.</p>
<h4 id="what-happens-when-you-get-this-right">WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU GET THIS RIGHT</h4>
<p>As an example, this is what happens when a digital twin strategy is effectively implemented:</p>

<h4 id="manufacturing-digital-twin-use-cases">MANUFACTURING DIGITAL TWIN USE-CASES</h4>
<p><strong>MANUFACTURING</strong></p>
<p>We are seeing an emerging trend amongst the manufacturing industry. There seems to be a consensus that digital twins will be the catalyst that ushers in the fourth industrial revolution, much like previous revolutions, players who fail to keep up with advancing technology will be left behind.</p>
<p>Digital twins will transform the entire product lifestyle. This includes revolutionary product design and immersive planning simulations, to faster product development and product functionality.</p>
<p>A key aspect of smart manufacturing that is still largely untapped, is Digital Twin technology on demand as a way for Original Equipment Manufacturers to differentiate their offering. By offering a digital twin alongside their product as a “Software As A Service” OEM’s can create new value for customers, while exploring new avenues of monetization.</p>
