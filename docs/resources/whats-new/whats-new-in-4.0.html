<h3 id="notifications">Notifications</h3>
<p>Set up rule-based notifications to trigger when an alert gets generated, if it has been pending for a period of time, or if a team member leaves a note. Users can also manage their own notification settings to decide which alerts they would like to receive.</p>

<h3 id="mobile-experience">Mobile Experience</h3>
<p>Whether your team works underground or out in the field, they can use XMPRO in the browser on their mobile device to get access to the recommendation alerts they need to respond to critical events. This update also provides offline capability and is available on both iOS and Android devices.</p>

<h2 id="azure-digital-twins">Azure Digital Twins</h2>
<p>XMPro version 4 includes two new Agents and a Connector to help you make the most of Azure Digital Twins without coding.</p>
<!-- Image needed: Azure-DT -->
<h4 id="azure-dt-context-provider">Azure DT Context Provider</h4>
<p>The new Context Provider allows you to fetch contextual data like the asset make and model from Azure Digital Twins.</p>
<h4 id="azure-dt-action-agent">Azure DT Action Agent</h4>
<p>The Action Agent enables you to create instances in Azure Digital Twins, upload DTDL models and set up new resources without having to leave the XMPro interface.</p>
<p>You can also automatically send data to Time Series Insights when the Azure Digital Twin receives new real-time data.</p>
<h4 id="azure-dt-app-designer-connector">Azure DT App Designer Connector</h4>
<p>This addition to the toolbox makes it easy to integrate Azure Digital Twins with your XMPro applications. You can use Azure DT as a data source or even create custom XMPro Apps with forms that update your digital twins in Microsoft Azure DT.</p>
<h2 id="recurring-data-streams">Recurring Data Streams</h2>
<p>This functionality allows you to run recurring Data Streams on a customizable schedule, for instance, once a day at 12 am.</p>
<p>This may be useful if you only want to read data or perform an action with the data at certain points during the day, or if you want to perform actions on the data once a week, month or year.</p>
<h2 id="app-designer-toolbox">App Designer Toolbox</h2>
<p>We're constantly adding new blocks to the App Designer toolbox to provide you with more no-code functionality for your real-time apps. Here are some of the latest additions to the toolbox:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unity</strong> - leverage the powerful gaming engine for real-time 3D visualizations and simulations</li>
<li><strong>D3</strong> - produce custom interactive data visualizations with fast loading times</li>
<li><strong>Esri Maps</strong> - display maps with geographical, terrain, or topographical overlays</li>
<li><strong>PowerBI</strong> - embed reports and historical data analytics visualizations into your applications</li>
<li><strong>Autodesk Forge</strong> - embed 2D and 3D engineering designs in your apps</li>
</ul>
