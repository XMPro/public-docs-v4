<p><strong>Sydney, Australia, 7 May 2012</strong> – XMPro, a leading Australian provider of Business Process Management solutions, has been selected by Gartner as a Cool Vendors (see footnote) in Business Process Management (BPM).</p>
<p>Each year, Gartner publishes a series of research reports in key technology areas that identifies undiscovered vendors with innovative products and services. This year five vendors are profiled in the 2012 BPM Cool Vendors report illustrating the use of cloud, mobile, social, and information forces that are reshaping the use of IT. XMPro, an Australian, BPM Vendor has been named a Cool BPM Vendor based on innovative, impactful and intriguing technology</p>
<p>According to the report, organisations who use these [newly selected BPM Cool Vendors] don’t just view business processes as a static, repeatable set of flows. Instead, they seek dynamic BPM rules-driven processes that change on the fly. These BPM vendors focus on providing mobile access to business processes from a variety of devices, consuming BPM technology in the cloud and support social BPM. The five vendors profiled in this research focus on knowledge-intensive processes that require case management, advanced decisioning, and intelligent business operations. BPM platforms accelerate time to results in business process improvement (BPI) projects, and form a foundation for creating and maintaining next-generation, composite applications.</p>
<p>Pieter van Schalkwyk, CEO of XMPro, said, “We believe being classed a Gartner BPM Cool Vendor exemplifies our solution as a forerunner in keys areas where BPM is changing to accommodate the demands of current business environments. Aiming for Intelligent Business Process Management, this report justifies our solution and qualifies our ability to handle dynamic BPM which is driven by business rules that change at any point in time.”</p>
<p>XMPro has the ability to trigger rules at the actual activity in the process or in the form field, which provides the flexibility to handle process exceptions and complex processes that have many route options. This functionality acts as “an umbrella” which coordinates repeatable and unstructured process interactions involving human tasks, decisions, SharePoint, Outlook and enterprise applications. “Our customers comment on the power they have gained through synching their technology and accessing information in one place no matter how complex a process gets”, said van Schalkwyk.</p>
<p>XMPro has the ability to deploy a process to multiple user interfaces which include mobile devices. “Customers access their process activities from interfaces that are the most convenient for their organisation, including their Outlook, SharePoint Portal, or mobile devices. We are proud of XMPro’s monitoring capability (XMPro Insight) as well as the number of connectors we have built into the solution used to accelerate integration to common systems and applications that bring unique value to our clients. We want our solution to be intuitive and easy to use” said van Schalkwyk.</p>
<p>XMPro offers to BPI Leaders:</p>
<ul>
<li>SharePoint-based BPMS that allows business stakeholders to easily modify processes and rules to support ad hoc, unstructured collaboration.</li>
<li>A platform on which to build process-centric applications that span SharePoint, Outlook, and enterprise applications.</li>
<li>Partnership opportunities with a BPMS vendor in Australia, United States, United Kingdom, Europe, Brazil, New Zealand and South Africa.</li>
</ul>
