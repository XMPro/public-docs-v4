<h2 id="use-case-examples">Use Case Examples</h2>
<h2 id="process-optimizer-digital-twin-for-power-utilities">Process Optimizer Digital Twin for Power Utilities</h2>
<p>In the power utility sector, the use of an AI-based â€˜heat-rate optimizer,â€™ which analyzes numerous data points in real-time and suggests performance enhancements, can overcome optimization challenges, potentially increasing efficiency by 1%, leading to substantial annual savings, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and more efficient use of workersâ€™ time</p>
<h2 id="computer-vision-for-quality-inspection-digital-twins">Computer Vision for Quality Inspection Digital Twins</h2>
<p>AI-powered Digital Twins in manufacturing can streamline cycle times, automate defect detection, and enhance inspection success, while also lowering CO2 emissions by over 10%, reducing product testing time by 45% for cost savings, and nearly eliminating defects and false alarms, a significant improvement over the previous error rate from human inspections.</p>
<h2 id="predictive-maintenance-of-underground-conveyors">Predictive Maintenance of Underground Conveyors</h2>
<p>AI-powered Digital Twins used for predictive maintenance of underground conveyors have facilitated real-time failure anticipation and efficient scheduling of maintenance, leading to significantly reduced downtime and an additional 44,000 tons of ore mined in a potash mine over five months which equates to millions of dollars of additional revenue.</p>
<h2 id="water-distribution-network-digital-twins">Water Distribution Network Digital Twins</h2>
<p>AI-powered Digital Twins are effectively used for real-time detection of pipe bursts in water distribution systems, where the system processes pressure and flow sensor data, predicts future values using artificial neural networks (ANN), and compares these with actual observations to gauge the probability of a failure event, thereby raising relevant alarms.</p>
