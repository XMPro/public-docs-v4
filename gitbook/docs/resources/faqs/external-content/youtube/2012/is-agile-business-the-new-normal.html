<p>In this webinar Pieter van Schalkwyk, MD of XMPro, will look at how &quot;Agile&quot; business changed the way we work and changed our expectation of the tools that support the way we work. Join Pieter for a 30 minute webinar that will change the way you think about the erratic and unstructured way of work that you may find yourself and your organisation in.</p>

<summary>Transcript</summary>are you finding that your routine work
<p>is replaced by knowledge style work is</p>
<p>your business and the process is more</p>
<p>complex than what they used to be are</p>
<p>exceptions becoming the norm now um</p>
<p>they're not the rule they're the norm uh</p>
<p>are the infrastructure or</p>
<p>the are the information management tools</p>
<p>that you use a lot more complex than</p>
<p>what they used to be and a lot more</p>
<p>sophis iated than what they used to be</p>
<p>and is it harder to manage all the</p>
<p>change in your organization as everyone</p>
<p>is stuck in this</p>
<p>analysis paralysis environment hi I'm</p>
<p>Peter F scalek I'm the chief agility</p>
<p>officer at XM Pro and I'd like to tell</p>
<p>you that agile business might be the new</p>
<p>normal for</p>
<p>you so if you look at this photo how</p>
<p>agile are you uh would you like to be</p>
<p>more</p>
<p>agile and probably not yourself if you</p>
<p>look at this photo but you can ask the</p>
<p>same question about your business would</p>
<p>you like your business to be um more</p>
<p>agile and would you so that you can bend</p>
<p>over backwards to accommodate changes in</p>
<p>business environment as you can see this</p>
<p>is pretty it looks pretty uncomfortable</p>
<p>but as soon as you've got the hang of it</p>
<p>it actually adds a lot of value um to</p>
<p>what you do so today we're going to talk</p>
<p>at we're going to have a look at how</p>
<p>agile business buiness change the way</p>
<p>that we work and also our expectations</p>
<p>of the tools that we use to manage that</p>
<p>work so essentially three things I'm</p>
<p>going to talk about today or that I'm</p>
<p>going to look at and the one is um how</p>
<p>did we change to Agile business now when</p>
<p>did this happen the second thing is uh</p>
<p>how did it change the way that we work</p>
<p>and then thirdly how do we change the</p>
<p>the tools that we use to</p>
<p>support uh this new way of work so let's</p>
<p>start with the first one is agile</p>
<p>business The New</p>
<p>Normal</p>
<p>so the first thing I'd like uh I'd like</p>
<p>to have a look is the change to Agile</p>
<p>you know the actual change that that</p>
<p>happens to Agile business and the um and</p>
<p>just looking at how did this</p>
<p>happen so uh and what do we mean by Adel</p>
<p>business so I'd like to approach this</p>
<p>once again from three different angles</p>
<p>and the first one is to look at the</p>
<p>dictionary definition of what agile</p>
<p>means and what I quite like is the fact</p>
<p>that it says it is a quick and</p>
<p>well-coordinated</p>
<p>uh um uh in movement sort of agile leap</p>
<p>and secondly the ability to think</p>
<p>quickly um and if you look at the</p>
<p>antonyms it's awkward sluggish and um</p>
<p>which of these describe your</p>
<p>business this might not be sort of quite</p>
<p>like what your business is right at the</p>
<p>moment or the the way that that you see</p>
<p>your uh the the current way that your</p>
<p>business work but</p>
<p>um is this the sort of way that your</p>
<p>business needs to go is uh from this</p>
<p>definition which you like to have a more</p>
<p>quick and responsive versus awkward and</p>
<p>sluggish type um business the challenge</p>
<p>is that that even though you may not be</p>
<p>making that change a lot of businesses</p>
<p>around you are doing that so for example</p>
<p>5 years ago the average product life</p>
<p>cycle was around 2 years and now it is</p>
<p>less than two months and in consumer</p>
<p>electronics it is even down to three</p>
<p>months for some products so I don't know</p>
<p>if you've noticed if you if you've gone</p>
<p>Buy Sony video camera or even just a d</p>
<p>notebook that three months after you</p>
<p>bought a specific model it's no longer</p>
<p>available the whole product life cycles</p>
<p>become so quick and everything around us</p>
<p>has become um has become active and</p>
<p>Lively rather than</p>
<p>sluggish software is gone the same way</p>
<p>how often do you find that your iPhone</p>
<p>has install app updates um mine does it</p>
<p>at least once a week on the software</p>
<p>itself and if you look at guys like</p>
<p>Microsoft which uh in the enterprise</p>
<p>software space you'll find that</p>
<p>Microsoft Office seem to have a new</p>
<p>version every year and I here with</p>
<p>Windows 8 they not um they're now</p>
<p>talking Windows 7 Windows 8 and I'm not</p>
<p>sure I know they've started working on</p>
<p>Windows 9 so they can't use Windows 2008</p>
<p>anymore because within 201 in 11 124 and</p>
<p>by the time we get to Windows 2016</p>
<p>they'll probably have um one every</p>
<p>quarter so uh they had to change the</p>
<p>numbering convention just to be able to</p>
<p>to uh accommodate the change that we see</p>
<p>um in in as everything accelerates and</p>
<p>and it goes forward so if we look at um</p>
<p>at agile from a from a software</p>
<p>perspective and most people know agile</p>
<p>as a software development methodology</p>
<p>this is not what this talk is around it</p>
<p>is not um but it really gives us a good</p>
<p>framework to understand how other</p>
<p>um areas of business have adopted an</p>
<p>agile approach in actual fact the agile</p>
<p>guys have come when I say agile guys</p>
<p>agile software development guys have</p>
<p>have come up with what they call the</p>
<p>agile</p>
<p>Manifesto and um because of this fast</p>
<p>changing Pace in software development um</p>
<p>and we can we can replace a lot of the</p>
<p>words in here with business words um but</p>
<p>what I'm going to do right now is just</p>
<p>very quickly um it's all around</p>
<p>interactions it's all around things that</p>
<p>work right now instead of spending your</p>
<p>life</p>
<p>designning it doesn't say that they</p>
<p>don't there's no documentation but it's</p>
<p>making sure that there's working</p>
<p>software working business processes</p>
<p>working uh in business intelligence or</p>
<p>whatever the case instead of spending so</p>
<p>much time if you look at um the bi tools</p>
<p>the whole uh um intelligent</p>
<p>experimentation um I love that term for</p>
<p>for BPM as well but the whole working</p>
<p>software concept so you get your bi</p>
<p>working quickly get your BPM working</p>
<p>quick get your strategies working</p>
<p>quickly instead of spending a lot of</p>
<p>time trying to document um that and then</p>
<p>also collaboration of uh contract</p>
<p>negotiation so there's a continuous</p>
<p>collaboration um in this whole agile</p>
<p>approach so if you look at s the</p>
<p>software</p>
<p>um uh world as a methodology um they</p>
<p>were the leading guys in this and and</p>
<p>and it's a great example of what I see</p>
<p>as agile as a methodology even for</p>
<p>businesses and business processes and</p>
<p>they've come up with 12 principles I'm</p>
<p>not going to go through through all of</p>
<p>them you can actually um look it up at</p>
<p>the agile manifesto. org um some of the</p>
<p>interesting things are that the highest</p>
<p>priority is to satisy is to satisfy the</p>
<p>customer and to continuously deliver</p>
<p>value you can take the software out um</p>
<p>and you can continuously make changes</p>
<p>because that is what happens in an agile</p>
<p>world there's continuous changes you</p>
<p>deliver new working things regularly um</p>
<p>that doesn't mean to say that's that</p>
<p>it's uncontrolled it's actually a lot of</p>
<p>control in in in the whole agile uh</p>
<p>world it is um it is quite simple but it</p>
<p>embodies the whole radical change of</p>
<p>what we've seen in the software world</p>
<p>where we've gone from a top down</p>
<p>programming like um some of myself and</p>
<p>and a couple of other people on this</p>
<p>webinar may may remember the days that</p>
<p>we did a structured Cobalt programming</p>
<p>um where we had a whole top down</p>
<p>approach those of us in Fortran that did</p>
<p>still did um coding on sheets will</p>
<p>remember top down um and we had to use a</p>
<p>waterfall model you had to specify</p>
<p>everything right to the end degree um</p>
<p>because it was really hard to make any</p>
<p>changes and so from a the waterfall</p>
<p>model which is a very structured you</p>
<p>specify you develop you test everything</p>
<p>in in in in and there are no changes to</p>
<p>the to</p>
<p>the um spec at any or or or to what you</p>
<p>what you deliver all requirements are</p>
<p>locked down based on that specification</p>
<p>because of the way that top- down</p>
<p>programming used to work and it reminds</p>
<p>me of structured business process as</p>
<p>well um so the release Cycles were long</p>
<p>and uh you couldn't move from the spec</p>
<p>it didn't really work well</p>
<p>um if we look at all the overruns and</p>
<p>things um on that where it's a very</p>
<p>rigid and strictly controlled process</p>
<p>what has happened with new programming</p>
<p>languages is that we've got a the whole</p>
<p>object orientation which is sort of an</p>
<p>unstructured programming approach for</p>
<p>lack of a better description um I'm</p>
<p>pretty sure the technical guys will will</p>
<p>Grill me for this but I see it as a as a</p>
<p>sort of we create all these functions</p>
<p>and I can call them at any point in time</p>
<p>so if you look at and one of the things</p>
<p>the key drivers for this was the change</p>
<p>that windows and these graphical</p>
<p>interfaces brought if I right click on</p>
<p>my mouse there's an action that I need</p>
<p>to do um so it needs to call that</p>
<p>specific object it needs to do what it</p>
<p>needs to do and uh then it goes away so</p>
<p>that with that the whole Agile</p>
<p>development methodology also started</p>
<p>because I can make these small little</p>
<p>chunks um of object code and I can call</p>
<p>it I can uh it doesn't have to be</p>
<p>sequential it's not top down I can call</p>
<p>it when I need it um it sort of created</p>
<p>a a a a whole new opportunity to create</p>
<p>Agile development tools as well where we</p>
<p>can shorten the development cycle we can</p>
<p>get products out quicker um and um it</p>
<p>it's easier to add functions without</p>
<p>breaking the logic which is one of the</p>
<p>challenges that we that you have with</p>
<p>with top- down structured programming</p>
<p>and that's why the whole waterfall model</p>
<p>worked well for that um what's nice with</p>
<p>the agile software development</p>
<p>methodology is that it's flexible and it</p>
<p>allows uh for a Agile development</p>
<p>approach um which is essentially what we</p>
<p>want in in in uh in a lot of what we do</p>
<p>in business as well so does that if if</p>
<p>if you replace some of these words that</p>
<p>I've got on the screen here with</p>
<p>business type words</p>
<p>um like the one that I just love is the</p>
<p>Simplicity the art of maximizing the</p>
<p>amount of work not done is essential now</p>
<p>to me that is really just such a</p>
<p>profound statement of what you want to</p>
<p>do in business what we find is everyone</p>
<p>is making it just so much harder to do</p>
<p>stuff and our Approach at at XM Pro is</p>
<p>really to is really to see how can we</p>
<p>maximize the art of uh sorry how can we</p>
<p>um how can we Perfect The Art of</p>
<p>maximizing the amount of work not done</p>
<p>so the whole agile software software</p>
<p>um development methodology um quite well</p>
<p>known and it's it's it's it's got its</p>
<p>challenges um but it's really if you</p>
<p>look at what the objective is and what</p>
<p>it's trying to to achieve it really</p>
<p>suits the way that businesses work right</p>
<p>now um so those are the 12 um principles</p>
<p>and you can substitute a lot of the</p>
<p>software words with business words and</p>
<p>um and it may sound a little bit like</p>
<p>what your business is or what you would</p>
<p>like your business to be like</p>
<p>so um one of the best definitions i'</p>
<p>I've seen of agility and it comes out of</p>
<p>a</p>
<p>CIO um magazine uh is really uh it was</p>
<p>done by Michael um shre uh and it's the</p>
<p>in the he says in the first and final</p>
<p>analysis agility is is about timely and</p>
<p>coste effective implementation and that</p>
<p>is a key driver these days things need</p>
<p>to be cost effective even doesn't matter</p>
<p>what we Implement with it's a software</p>
<p>BAS solution whether it's business</p>
<p>intelligence whether it's BPM um whether</p>
<p>it's strategy planning whether it</p>
<p>doesn't really matter what it is um but</p>
<p>what he says is that is the key part</p>
<p>full stop there's no question about it</p>
<p>needs to be timely and cost effective</p>
<p>planning is nice analysis is good</p>
<p>governance is groovy but agility means</p>
<p>action agility implies both the capacity</p>
<p>and capability to act now</p>
<p>immediately real time to me this is such</p>
<p>a powerful statement of what we're</p>
<p>trying to achieve in business we need to</p>
<p>have the capacity and the capability to</p>
<p>act we need to do it right now we need</p>
<p>to make the changes right now and we</p>
<p>would like to do it in real time now</p>
<p>there are some challenges with putting</p>
<p>some of these things in and that's</p>
<p>really one of exm Pro's driving</p>
<p>Ambitions is to is to make sure that we</p>
<p>can achieve this with um with business</p>
<p>processes as</p>
<p>well so is that how we should see uh</p>
<p>business processes um if I look at what</p>
<p>we used to do in terms of modeling all</p>
<p>the as EES and 2bs and um and trying to</p>
<p>come up with the writing um this whole</p>
<p>agility process would get us to our</p>
<p>business objectives a lot quicker so</p>
<p>what is a agile business process so I'm</p>
<p>just going to quickly um talk about and</p>
<p>I've got business slpress because it's</p>
<p>actually business um but a key driver of</p>
<p>business is business processes and exm</p>
<p>pro business is business processes so uh</p>
<p>we are not a workflow tool we are</p>
<p>Process Management tool and process is</p>
<p>just by definition uh is not necessarily</p>
<p>sequential uh or um a workflow it is it</p>
<p>is</p>
<p>activities that drive a specific</p>
<p>business outcome and they don't need to</p>
<p>be in a sequential uh uh form so so far</p>
<p>we've looked at um the agile definition</p>
<p>of what uh of what uh agile um method</p>
<p>sorry we've looked at the the dictionary</p>
<p>definition of what agile business is</p>
<p>we've also um looked at um at the</p>
<p>um sort of software methodology and and</p>
<p>when we look at businesses um we see</p>
<p>there's a definite shift in in business</p>
<p>from the predictable to unpredictable uh</p>
<p>I I know for a fact we find it hard to</p>
<p>get five people in a room and get them</p>
<p>to have the same view or version of a</p>
<p>process or uh or a business outcome or</p>
<p>or something like that so easiest way to</p>
<p>look at at at at the um agile business</p>
<p>or business process is to actually look</p>
<p>at the drivers that influence this</p>
<p>change from May from from a very</p>
<p>structured approach where we knew um</p>
<p>exactly how how business worked uh going</p>
<p>into this whole agile um business</p>
<p>approach and Peter draer coined the</p>
<p>phrase so there's the there's um there's</p>
<p>essentially three drivers and one of the</p>
<p>biggest drivers is is is the fact that</p>
<p>we've got this whole new knowledge</p>
<p>worker and Peter draer um uh uh everyone</p>
<p>in the management world NZ um Peter dra</p>
<p>is one of the biggest gurus around</p>
<p>um management strategy and he coined the</p>
<p>phrase knowledge</p>
<p>worker and uh essentially a knowledge</p>
<p>worker is is a is a move away from doing</p>
<p>workers to thinking workers um these are</p>
<p>people who have contextual knowledge</p>
<p>around</p>
<p>processes and they can make decisions</p>
<p>based on this structured processes don't</p>
<p>really work and they have to circumvent</p>
<p>structured processes because they want</p>
<p>to make their own decisions around</p>
<p>routing around logic around all sorts of</p>
<p>things doesn't mean it's uncontrolled</p>
<p>there's still control around uh</p>
<p>knowledge workers but it just means that</p>
<p>they can make their own decisions on a</p>
<p>lot of how uh processes works if you</p>
<p>think back around the the what I'd</p>
<p>explained around the top down</p>
<p>programming versus the object Pro object</p>
<p>orientation programming they are they</p>
<p>work in a world of object orientation if</p>
<p>they need to right click the mouse it</p>
<p>needs to respond to that not workers are</p>
<p>like that so if they have contextual</p>
<p>information they know something about a</p>
<p>process and I'm I'll explain a little</p>
<p>bit more bit later in the in the in the</p>
<p>uh presentation around the knowledge</p>
<p>workers but if or or around this</p>
<p>unstructured work or uh but as soon as</p>
<p>they know if if they have contextual</p>
<p>knowledge or if they know the context in</p>
<p>with in which this process is happening</p>
<p>they can make decisions which will rout</p>
<p>it in a different way it'll have</p>
<p>different business rules so exceptions</p>
<p>for them are the rule um and the rigid</p>
<p>workflow style processes don't really</p>
<p>work so if you've got a rigid workflow</p>
<p>engine that drive the work that they</p>
<p>need to do that's why they use</p>
<p>email um so these used to be the</p>
<p>exceptional jobs but right now we find</p>
<p>with the right that technology enables</p>
<p>our</p>
<p>work that it even goes down right to the</p>
<p>lower levels of work so there's a whole</p>
<p>shift to knowledge workers even into</p>
<p>areas that weren't traditionally</p>
<p>knowledge workers so if we look at the</p>
<p>second reason why we've become uh why</p>
<p>there's a move to Agile business it is</p>
<p>really that we've become interrupt</p>
<p>driven now what I mean by that is email</p>
<p>conditions us to stop and start all the</p>
<p>time we don't work in a sequential way</p>
<p>anymore I don't know if you do it um I I</p>
<p>personally if I see an email come in I</p>
<p>will stop whatever else I'm doing and</p>
<p>I'll attend to the email sometimes I do</p>
<p>three or four things at the same time</p>
<p>not that I do um</p>
<p>great job of that um but we've become</p>
<p>interrupt driven so we are used to the</p>
<p>fact that we don't do things in a long</p>
<p>sequential logic or in a in a in a in a</p>
<p>sequential State anymore the other thing</p>
<p>that has happened is conversations are</p>
<p>are now 140</p>
<p>characters um and uh by that I mean with</p>
<p>Twitter uh things like um Twitter has</p>
<p>changed the way that we see</p>
<p>conversations and how we can do</p>
<p>conversations and it's not just Twitter</p>
<p>they're tools like yamama socialcast and</p>
<p>all of those inside organizations that</p>
<p>are now have key parts of conversations</p>
<p>in them that's how we talk that's how we</p>
<p>collaborate um and they broken up into</p>
<p>into into little bit so we've become</p>
<p>interrupt driven in the way so I can</p>
<p>have certain parts of my messaging and</p>
<p>conversation in Yama and I can have an</p>
<p>email and I can have a whole lot of um</p>
<p>of</p>
<p>um uh uh different interrupt driven ways</p>
<p>uh there's tools like like MSN so I</p>
<p>might just also have a quick MSN chat</p>
<p>and office is looking at productizing</p>
<p>what the office Microsoft is looking at</p>
<p>productizing something they call office</p>
<p>talk we'll probably see it in the next</p>
<p>versions of office CRM and all those</p>
<p>products where it comes with a built-in</p>
<p>collaboration component or Twitter for</p>
<p>business or whatever weever whatever we</p>
<p>want to call that um the third driver</p>
<p>for agile business so the first one was</p>
<p>the fact that we knowledge workers the</p>
<p>second one is that we're now interrupt</p>
<p>driven and the third one which has had a</p>
<p>profound impact is actually uh mua's law</p>
<p>which say and because a lot of the work</p>
<p>that we do these days and doesn't matter</p>
<p>in what uh what type of job it is in</p>
<p>organization uh we find more and more um</p>
<p>that that people people use computers to</p>
<p>to do parts of their work and processing</p>
<p>power inside computers are doubling</p>
<p>every two years now if you look at this</p>
<p>graph is unbelievable um if you look at</p>
<p>the i7 processor that we have right now</p>
<p>in most of our in most of our uh</p>
<p>notebooks that we carry around you'll</p>
<p>find that it's got 2.6 billion transa uh</p>
<p>transactions on a chip uh interesting</p>
<p>conversation with a financial guy this</p>
<p>morning said to me so uh how many are</p>
<p>there in a packet if there's 2.6 billion</p>
<p>on a chip not everyone understands that</p>
<p>so um he said as a joke but um yeah so</p>
<p>that gives you some some perspective of</p>
<p>of what is happening with computing</p>
<p>power this just drives um what we can do</p>
<p>with computers and the way that we can</p>
<p>that we can use it what is more</p>
<p>interesting is uh Zuckerberg's law so we</p>
<p>had mu's Lord came out he's he was the</p>
<p>CEO of Intel at the time as far as I can</p>
<p>recall um mu but Mark Zuckerberg the CEO</p>
<p>of Facebook has come out with with a a</p>
<p>very interesting uh very similar and is</p>
<p>based on mu's law which is the law of</p>
<p>social sharing which says that we will</p>
<p>double the content that we share every</p>
<p>two years on social networks and they</p>
<p>base it on what they see in Facebook</p>
<p>right now there are around five billion</p>
<p>things statuses images videos all of</p>
<p>that shared on Facebook a day now this</p>
<p>was announced in SE end of September in</p>
<p>2011 at the F fi developers conference</p>
<p>so this is pretty recent um stats as</p>
<p>well four billion things and his view is</p>
<p>that this will double in the next per</p>
<p>per person we will double the um amount</p>
<p>what we share in a social way um or in a</p>
<p>collaborative way so all of these things</p>
<p>are driving um and it's got a a massive</p>
<p>impact on business because it actually</p>
<p>drives um what we do now I've got my own</p>
<p>my own law which I call F sc's law and I</p>
<p>hope it'll catch on which uh and the</p>
<p>statement is that business agility will</p>
<p>double every two years if we take all</p>
<p>these factors into consideration M's law</p>
<p>zacher BG's law and all the um social</p>
<p>phenomena that we see and the interrupt</p>
<p>driven I predict that we will become</p>
<p>twice as agile every so we will double</p>
<p>our agility every two years um that's</p>
<p>from sc's law and you can quote me on</p>
<p>that then uh Steve uh Keith snon and</p>
<p>Sandy kemsley um Keith Swinson is the</p>
<p>R&amp;D vice president for fitso based in</p>
<p>the US he writes a lot on BPM case</p>
<p>management all of those sort of things</p>
<p>and S kimley is a well</p>
<p>recognized</p>
<p>um BPM analyst and she does she she also</p>
<p>does a lot of writing research and she's</p>
<p>got a great blog as well which I can</p>
<p>recommend and they've come up with if</p>
<p>you look at agile</p>
<p>BPM in a in a webinar that they did on</p>
<p>uh agile BPM using uh well just looking</p>
<p>at how process of change and what I like</p>
<p>about this is that the goal of the</p>
<p>system so when we look at the</p>
<p>transactional system the are the and</p>
<p>it's not that these are going away</p>
<p>that's the 8020 principle 20% of</p>
<p>processes will still be transactional we</p>
<p>still have a reg structure but we have a</p>
<p>80% of business and this is from Gartner</p>
<p>that came up with the 8020 um Janelle</p>
<p>Hill um at Gartner but the the the</p>
<p>what's great about this is that the that</p>
<p>the goal of the system in the past was</p>
<p>just efficiency and automation now it's</p>
<p>moved to problem resolution we can</p>
<p>actually do stuff with this so it's not</p>
<p>just about getting people to do things</p>
<p>faster but it's actually to solve</p>
<p>problems um and the the challenge is</p>
<p>that instead of being highly repeatable</p>
<p>it's become unpredictable so you need</p>
<p>tools to to to kind for um for that</p>
<p>so how does that change the way that we</p>
<p>work I said earlier that there are three</p>
<p>questions uh and and the first one was</p>
<p>why did we</p>
<p>um um</p>
<p>so just to step back</p>
<p>um of those three questions the first</p>
<p>one is agile business um and to me this</p>
<p>describes that agile business is The New</p>
<p>Normal so how does it change the way</p>
<p>that we work</p>
<p>well um in terms of the three questions</p>
<p>the first one was why did we change to</p>
<p>Agile business the second one is is um</p>
<p>is um how do we change the work and then</p>
<p>lastly we'll also look at the tools that</p>
<p>we that that we do this so if I just</p>
<p>quickly go back and we look at the 12</p>
<p>principles of the agile methodology</p>
<p>we'll recognize that that that um that</p>
<p>some of these have a profound</p>
<p>way profound impact on the way that</p>
<p>agile business has changed the way that</p>
<p>we work so so the first one is all</p>
<p>around continuous Improvement so we've</p>
<p>moved away from this trying to to get</p>
<p>one to get the spec for the process</p>
<p>which which was the BPR way the business</p>
<p>process re-engineering way we would</p>
<p>spend a lot of money to get Consultants</p>
<p>into can spend a lot of time and it's</p>
<p>not that we don't do that agile doesn't</p>
<p>say no documentation it means adequate</p>
<p>documentation so that we can uh get the</p>
<p>first version out quickly and we can</p>
<p>start improving on that so instead of</p>
<p>doing three years of BPR we can get the</p>
<p>base requirements down um without</p>
<p>spending all our time and money on that</p>
<p>and by the time you've got the base</p>
<p>requirement oh sorry if you do the</p>
<p>threeyear BPR project by the time we get</p>
<p>to do something all our processes have</p>
<p>changed we'd like to take a lot more of</p>
<p>a continuous Improvement proc approach</p>
<p>um in most of the work that we do these</p>
<p>days doesn't matter what it is um we'd</p>
<p>like to do smaller chunks we like to get</p>
<p>results a lot quicker and we'd like to</p>
<p>see things happen um a a lot easier and</p>
<p>I just love the next slide which is um</p>
<p>salvad doy said have no fear of</p>
<p>perfection you will never reach it to me</p>
<p>that is so so profound as well in terms</p>
<p>of what you're trying to achieve do</p>
<p>enough to from a we we find that right</p>
<p>now um the way that we work is become</p>
<p>let's do enough so we can get started</p>
<p>and get something done a lot of</p>
<p>businesses especially the ones that</p>
<p>perform uh well I've taken that um that</p>
<p>approach the second thing is what we</p>
<p>want to do is is sort of have what we</p>
<p>call intelligent experimentation I love</p>
<p>this for BPM but it's actually a phrase</p>
<p>that is used in the BR world uh um</p>
<p>that's where I've I've heard it um being</p>
<p>used but intelligent experimentation</p>
<p>doesn't mean um we just it still means</p>
<p>that we work in a controlled fashion we</p>
<p>take information from our analytics</p>
<p>tools from the process uh from from our</p>
<p>um analytics is a great driver for this</p>
<p>so we'll get information out of our</p>
<p>analytics tools and decide how we're</p>
<p>going to change it we're going to split</p>
<p>test certain things the the marketing</p>
<p>guys are brilliant at split testing ads</p>
<p>so that they can see which is the best</p>
<p>performing one and they'll drop the</p>
<p>other one and then start a new um</p>
<p>process uh uh ad that will compete with</p>
<p>the other one and and so that's how they</p>
<p>sort of um through a evolutionary</p>
<p>process build um the the strongest AD</p>
<p>that they can just continuous testing</p>
<p>there's no reason why we why we can't do</p>
<p>that in other areas of business and we</p>
<p>starting to we starting we start to see</p>
<p>that that emerges in a in a in a lot of</p>
<p>that we do so</p>
<p>um the other the other um great one that</p>
<p>I saw and this is this is once again</p>
<p>Gartner I take credit for this is to</p>
<p>design by doing rather than doing by</p>
<p>design gner has now come out and said</p>
<p>listen Maybe maybe you don't need to</p>
<p>spend as much time on trying to get that</p>
<p>or to strive for Perfection to get the</p>
<p>spec 100% right rather design by doing</p>
<p>it and as you do you improve it rather</p>
<p>than trying to do this whole design and</p>
<p>get the right thing um because you will</p>
<p>actually never never get there we find</p>
<p>more and more where there's a drive and</p>
<p>this impacts the way that we work uh and</p>
<p>it doesn't only apply to BPM it applies</p>
<p>to a whole lot of uh areas that Gardener</p>
<p>um in terms of the competency areas that</p>
<p>they apply this design by doing now so</p>
<p>there's a definite impact um on that and</p>
<p>then also we change our minds often</p>
<p>that's always been the case we just</p>
<p>never had the opportunity to change our</p>
<p>mind or to say that we'd like our</p>
<p>requirements to differ um what has</p>
<p>happened with uh with</p>
<p>um the new tools especially we and</p>
<p>social tools we have the ability to</p>
<p>change our mind often and that is now</p>
<p>getting into the way that we work we</p>
<p>expect things to change quickly we</p>
<p>expect next time uh that uh that there's</p>
<p>update on uh on Facebook that my um</p>
<p>iPhone app will automatically pick it up</p>
<p>um I don't have to worry about it so we</p>
<p>can change our minds often we can um and</p>
<p>that's got a profound impact on on on</p>
<p>the way that we that we work so once</p>
<p>again and I keep going back to this um</p>
<p>but really if you take those 12</p>
<p>principles and and you just apply the</p>
<p>business side of it you can see how this</p>
<p>impact the way that we uh the way that</p>
<p>we work</p>
<p>um So based on that agile work is The</p>
<p>New Normal we don't work the way that we</p>
<p>that we used to work we expect uh that</p>
<p>we will be experimenting we expect that</p>
<p>we'll be changing our mind so we've we</p>
<p>we we we have come up with a agile work</p>
<p>approach which we see as The New Normal</p>
<p>so in the last place I'm just going to</p>
<p>quickly talk around the tools that we</p>
<p>need to manage this so I've I've given</p>
<p>you um how business have changed and how</p>
<p>the work that we've done have changed so</p>
<p>they the the only thing that now still</p>
<p>needs to that remains that needs to</p>
<p>change is the actual tools because the</p>
<p>old tools don't work anymore the old way</p>
<p>that we've done things um don't work</p>
<p>anymore with this whole agile business</p>
<p>approach and once again I just want to</p>
<p>remind you it's not agile software</p>
<p>methodology even though it's a great</p>
<p>it's it's a great analogy around what</p>
<p>has happened in business but this is</p>
<p>really these are business tools that we</p>
<p>use anything from your bi tools to um to</p>
<p>to your BPM tools or whatever the case</p>
<p>might be um how many of you are still in</p>
<p>the water in the waterfall mode the</p>
<p>workflow style um versus the more struct</p>
<p>or unstructured uh um object orientation</p>
<p>or agile uh style so um you know only</p>
<p>20% of businesses can actually survive</p>
<p>on the on the</p>
<p>um uh on the sorry only 20% of processes</p>
<p>in sort of inside of organization will</p>
<p>survive on your old tools the others</p>
<p>need new tools and if you're not going</p>
<p>to provide it it will circum circumvent</p>
<p>that so just quickly going back to what</p>
<p>we want to achieve we want continuous</p>
<p>Improvement we want intelligent</p>
<p>experimentation we want designed by</p>
<p>doing and want to change our minds often</p>
<p>so how do we do that um well with XM Pro</p>
<p>for example we give you the ability to</p>
<p>create this Dynamic interrupt driven</p>
<p>processes you don't have to draw the</p>
<p>flow people can can sequence these at</p>
<p>runtime for example so we've got inside</p>
<p>as a feature we can do unstructured</p>
<p>process configuration this is not a runr</p>
<p>through of all the the features that we</p>
<p>have in exm Pro it is a very</p>
<p>comprehensive big uh application and it</p>
<p>does a whole lot of things I've I'm I'm</p>
<p>not not even scratching the surface on</p>
<p>on on most of the functionality I just</p>
<p>want to I just want to highlight the</p>
<p>fact that if if you're going to use</p>
<p>agile BPM methodology um by getting</p>
<p>things out quickly getting a lot of</p>
<p>collaborative design um XM proos</p>
<p>unstructured process configuration</p>
<p>allows you to do that so in the same</p>
<p>breath if you want to do Dynamic</p>
<p>allocation of logic instead of writing a</p>
<p>lot of code and that sort of thing you</p>
<p>can use our new Dynamic allocation logic</p>
<p>which is part of of XM Pro as well if we</p>
<p>look at intelligent experimentation you</p>
<p>need versions of processes you want to</p>
<p>split test them against each other so X</p>
<p>and PR version management handles a lot</p>
<p>of um what you need there so um and then</p>
<p>lastly just as a as a as a agile</p>
<p>implementation methodology if you if</p>
<p>you're going to use agile in your</p>
<p>business and you you going to make your</p>
<p>business bend over backwards to</p>
<p>accommodate the changes that that you</p>
<p>have in your organization the XM Pro</p>
<p>allows you to do that it allows you to</p>
<p>to do to get processes out quickly it</p>
<p>allows you to do integration to external</p>
<p>applications quickly it allows you to um</p>
<p>to change the way a process work and</p>
<p>test it against another process quickly</p>
<p>it is an Ideal tool if you're looking at</p>
<p>a at a agile approach to fit your agile</p>
<p>business and our whole dynamic BPM</p>
<p>platform is really built around and we</p>
<p>ideally suited to uh organizations that</p>
<p>that instead of wanting to get a whole</p>
<p>um um group of business process</p>
<p>re-engineering Consultants there are</p>
<p>looking to to spec enough get it out</p>
<p>test it improve it and look at the</p>
<p>intelligent experimentation I just love</p>
<p>the term so you'll find that intelligent</p>
<p>tools will be the new normal I say is</p>
<p>The New Normal um yes it is here right</p>
<p>now a lot of companies haven't caught on</p>
<p>to that yet but agile tools will be the</p>
<p>new normal you're not going to be back</p>
<p>in the workflow days um workflow is only</p>
<p>a very small component of</p>
<p>it so thank you very much thank you for</p>
<p>joining us on this if you want to see a</p>
<p>lot more around how we can actually in</p>
<p>terms of the BPM agile methodology um</p>
<p>free to discuss it with ourselves or one</p>
<p>of our partners and we can also give you</p>
<p>a full demonstration of what XM Pro</p>
<p>is we'd love to talk to you about um uh</p>
<p>your agile or how your business can be</p>
<p>more agile going into the future and uh</p>
<p>thank you very much appreciate your time</p>
<p>listening to me</p>
