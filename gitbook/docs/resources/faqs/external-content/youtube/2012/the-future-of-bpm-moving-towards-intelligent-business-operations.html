<summary>Transcript</summary>hi and welcome to the XM Pro future of
<p>BPM I just want to make sure that</p>
<p>everyone can hear me so if you can maybe</p>
<p>just um</p>
<p>confirm that you can hear</p>
<p>me thanks very much great work is</p>
<p>changing faster than ever and the way</p>
<p>that we work is also changing faster</p>
<p>than ever we're more interrupt driven we</p>
<p>have more information or should I say</p>
<p>data than ever and the world around us</p>
<p>has become a lot more unpredictable than</p>
<p>ever I'm Peter F scal I'm the MD of X</p>
<p>and pro and I'd like to thank you for</p>
<p>joining me when we have um when we have</p>
<p>a look at at how we move from business</p>
<p>Process Management</p>
<p>to what Gartner is now calling</p>
<p>intelligent business operations and why</p>
<p>we have to do this and what the benefits</p>
<p>is of</p>
<p>that making sure I'm on the right screen</p>
<p>here so if we look at the drivers of</p>
<p>this</p>
<p>change um one of the aspects I'd like to</p>
<p>cover today and then also what uh just</p>
<p>some three elements of this uh internal</p>
<p>um intelligent business operations or</p>
<p>IBO so I'll just be calling it IBO</p>
<p>intelligent business operations um</p>
<p>another new free freeletter acronym that</p>
<p>we have and lastly we'll also just have</p>
<p>a look of an example of what it could</p>
<p>like or what IBO could look like and</p>
<p>does look like inside XM</p>
<p>Pro so why are we now talking about</p>
<p>intelligent business operations what are</p>
<p>the drivers for that</p>
<p>well businesses and the organizations</p>
<p>that support them are now more than ever</p>
<p>a lot more complex a lot more chaotic</p>
<p>and a lot more</p>
<p>unpredictable at the recent Gardner it</p>
<p>Expo where we were this CIO Summit the</p>
<p>keynote cited that the following</p>
<p>disruptive Technologies um is or are</p>
<p>changing the</p>
<p>um the landscape for businesses and</p>
<p>specifically cios and CEOs CFOs and</p>
<p>those drivers are essentially cloud</p>
<p>cloud adoption is a lot faster than what</p>
<p>most people anticipated and that brings</p>
<p>about a whole new change of how we work</p>
<p>social in the Enterprise is there it has</p>
<p>found its way in and we actually have a</p>
<p>separate webinar that you may have seen</p>
<p>around social lising how we handle</p>
<p>social lisening so social uh and social</p>
<p>media is now has found its way into the</p>
<p>Enterprise and it's not going to go away</p>
<p>so that's also changing the way that</p>
<p>people behave and that they expect the</p>
<p>tools that support them also</p>
<p>change the other interesting thing is</p>
<p>that mobile search is set to overtake</p>
<p>desktop search in the next two years um</p>
<p>we had a conversation recently with a</p>
<p>CIO that said their whole it strategy</p>
<p>has changed overnight when a CEO walked</p>
<p>in with his iPad into a board meeting</p>
<p>so those drivers combined with the fact</p>
<p>that we have all these systems that now</p>
<p>Drive data those three components plus</p>
<p>the big data that a lot of this generate</p>
<p>are the key drivers or the key</p>
<p>disruptive drivers according to Gardner</p>
<p>why this is all happening the challenge</p>
<p>that we have is how to make this work</p>
<p>inside our businesses and</p>
<p>organizations</p>
<p>so actually have a great and once again</p>
<p>I'm going to refer to to to Gardner for</p>
<p>this um and it actually comes out of</p>
<p>Janelle Hill's presentation around</p>
<p>operational resilience and where BPM is</p>
<p>going and she's saying that newer</p>
<p>Technologies including social media</p>
<p>context to Weare Technologies cloud and</p>
<p>all these things that I've just</p>
<p>mentioned the intelligent phones and</p>
<p>devices can re revolutionize the way we</p>
<p>work together um the challenge is</p>
<p>Enterprises have not yet empowered</p>
<p>Frontline employes to dynamically adjust</p>
<p>the way they work in response to these</p>
<p>contextual OPP opportunities or threats</p>
<p>and I'll explain more of this as we go</p>
<p>the other thing that we find is that the</p>
<p>software that we use at the moment um</p>
<p>cannot be applied to this knowledge</p>
<p>Centric work style and decision making</p>
<p>risk assessment patent seeking and</p>
<p>matching um group collaboration most of</p>
<p>these are are supported at the moment</p>
<p>with Point solution so you have a</p>
<p>specific application for um for um</p>
<p>patent seeking something for decision-</p>
<p>making something for risk assessment but</p>
<p>all of these the way that we work all of</p>
<p>these are converging into a single</p>
<p>environment the biggest challenge is</p>
<p>that as leading economies are</p>
<p>increasingly dependent on service based</p>
<p>Industries um a lot of that turns into</p>
<p>the fact that they're heavily dependent</p>
<p>on knowledge work on on uh knowledge</p>
<p>workers and managers that understand</p>
<p>that and they're all overwhelmed with</p>
<p>data and choices now that that is um</p>
<p>from from Janelle Hill at Gard how do we</p>
<p>turn that into into or how does that</p>
<p>relate to what we know so what does that</p>
<p>mean for BPM and how did we go from</p>
<p>workflow which is Factory style or</p>
<p>automation of of of of work I'm just</p>
<p>trying to get it done faster to</p>
<p>something like BPM with business Process</p>
<p>Management which is knowledge style</p>
<p>where we trying to have more control of</p>
<p>process if you look at what the</p>
<p>definition</p>
<p>of Process Management it's all around</p>
<p>control</p>
<p>um and having a lot</p>
<p>more management capability rather than</p>
<p>just automation so that we have some</p>
<p>idea of where it's going business um</p>
<p>intelligent business operation to me so</p>
<p>when we start off with workflow it's</p>
<p>factory style BPM it's knowledge style</p>
<p>intelligent business operation is all</p>
<p>around a gold driven style where we</p>
<p>actually trying to support business</p>
<p>outcomes or business objectives it's not</p>
<p>just around process control having</p>
<p>control and having order trials and</p>
<p>having</p>
<p>um and having decision trials but it's</p>
<p>also extending it to how can we better</p>
<p>support the outcomes of business best</p>
<p>way of looking at this is just to</p>
<p>looking at how the definition is changed</p>
<p>what what Gartner said a couple of years</p>
<p>ago we had a slide that says BPM is a it</p>
<p>enabled management discipline quite</p>
<p>simple they've now changed the</p>
<p>definition looking at this</p>
<p>operational excellence where there's</p>
<p>expectation for BPM to to support not</p>
<p>just the automation or it enablement of</p>
<p>managing processes um but there's</p>
<p>actually a bigger expectation around BPM</p>
<p>and that's moving us towards intelligent</p>
<p>business operation so according to them</p>
<p>BPM is a management discipline that</p>
<p>treats process as that asset a key part</p>
<p>you need a repository of processes that</p>
<p>you can access and you can treat treat</p>
<p>those as assets inside the business they</p>
<p>need to contribute directly to</p>
<p>Enterprise performance so and um a key</p>
<p>element of that which I like is the fact</p>
<p>that there's a clear line of sight for</p>
<p>metrics and outcomes so you need to</p>
<p>understand how this process that you</p>
<p>have as a process asset how that's how</p>
<p>that contributes to what your your</p>
<p>operational um Excellence is which is</p>
<p>the next step here by driving</p>
<p>operational uh ex excellence and Agility</p>
<p>I did a webinar not too long ago where I</p>
<p>was talking about um these things that</p>
<p>we do as supporting operational kpis in</p>
<p>the end of the at the end of the day uh</p>
<p>the operational kpis are what are are</p>
<p>what determines the success of a</p>
<p>business</p>
<p>so looking at BPM going forward it needs</p>
<p>to be a lot more around visibility</p>
<p>accountability and it also needs to</p>
<p>change as processes need to change once</p>
<p>again I just want to highlight some of</p>
<p>the facts Al some of the points that</p>
<p>they've made you around the the</p>
<p>attributes things like a clear line of</p>
<p>sight um for metrics and outcomes and</p>
<p>ability you must be able to change it</p>
<p>and the fact that</p>
<p>um uh uh these</p>
<p>um the business models uh that you</p>
<p>construct are not just around the flow</p>
<p>but it but it it needs to also show it</p>
<p>to all process participants so the when</p>
<p>you drive a process from an intelligent</p>
<p>business point of view that you actually</p>
<p>know what the process is going to do and</p>
<p>you understand the options so if we look</p>
<p>at intelligent business operations</p>
<p>itself</p>
<p>um the the reason why it's moving from</p>
<p>BPM to IBO is the fact that we want to</p>
<p>support this context ual knowledge work</p>
<p>what we mean by that is people now have</p>
<p>information around activities that they</p>
<p>do it's not just Factory style where I</p>
<p>just accept what comes from someone else</p>
<p>and I just do my little part of my</p>
<p>activity or process and pass it on that</p>
<p>is a factory style where it's almost</p>
<p>like machines in a</p>
<p>sequence the way that we work now is we</p>
<p>get information by from various sources</p>
<p>and as we take that contextual knowledge</p>
<p>our proc processors need to support that</p>
<p>processes are not that sequential</p>
<p>anymore processes um in actual fact they</p>
<p>can come from anywhere and they can go</p>
<p>anywhere we need to have better support</p>
<p>for decision- making that's a key part</p>
<p>of intelligent business operations how</p>
<p>do we how how do we make make better</p>
<p>decisions now that we've got all this</p>
<p>big data coming at us we've got more</p>
<p>dashboard tools than ever we've got more</p>
<p>metrics than ever how do we apply that</p>
<p>uh so that we can make better</p>
<p>decisions we don't work in isolation so</p>
<p>another objective of internal of</p>
<p>intelligent business um operations or</p>
<p>IBO is the fact that we need to take all</p>
<p>these conversations that we having all</p>
<p>the emails that we send around which are</p>
<p>currently not part of our processes or</p>
<p>workflows or or bpms and build that into</p>
<p>Bak that into our processes so that we</p>
<p>can incorporate some of the social rules</p>
<p>that come out of that and essentially</p>
<p>all it is um it it's all around getting</p>
<p>better at getting work done which is</p>
<p>what XM Pro is all about so if you look</p>
<p>at BPM going forward what does IB um IBO</p>
<p>really look like well in the first place</p>
<p>it needs to have support for</p>
<p>unstructured processes and also there's</p>
<p>a previous webinar where we discussed un</p>
<p>unstructured processes to some degree</p>
<p>but it really means that there's no</p>
<p>predefined flow so there's a a number of</p>
<p>activities or possibilities that we can</p>
<p>do and we can add to that so if we</p>
<p>discover new requirements that we have</p>
<p>we can add those what we mean by</p>
<p>unstructured process is you don't</p>
<p>necessarily have to draw the flow</p>
<p>diagram and I'll get into a little bit</p>
<p>more detail around that it also needs to</p>
<p>have support for what we call Dynamic</p>
<p>processes now unstructured doesn't mean</p>
<p>uncontrolled and dynamic processes are</p>
<p>different to unstructured processes a</p>
<p>dynamic process is where it can change</p>
<p>based on external events or external</p>
<p>influences or maybe some in some</p>
<p>instances internal rules that may</p>
<p>dictate and we'll look at some of the</p>
<p>examples of what a dynamic process is so</p>
<p>for an intelligent business process it</p>
<p>needs to be able to be agile it needs to</p>
<p>be unstructured and flexible it needs to</p>
<p>be able to adapt Itself by being a</p>
<p>dynamic and also it needs to incorporate</p>
<p>the social aspects</p>
<p>of um the way that we interact in work</p>
<p>we don't work in isolation and there's a</p>
<p>lot of conversation that goes around um</p>
<p>our activities and processes and all of</p>
<p>that combined gives us intelligent</p>
<p>business operations there are few more</p>
<p>elements to it but these are the three</p>
<p>main key things if you look at why we</p>
<p>looking at uh at at intelligent business</p>
<p>operations or what does it mean for you</p>
<p>it means that we can cater for a a</p>
<p>broader range of work we it's a lot more</p>
<p>intelligent in terms of how it can adapt</p>
<p>and we also incorporate conversations</p>
<p>from outside so if we look at those</p>
<p>three elements in a bit more detail so</p>
<p>if I look at unstructured um Dynamic and</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>social if we look at unstructured to</p>
<p>start off with now this is a typical</p>
<p>unstructured process and um this is exm</p>
<p>pro designer and this is just a very</p>
<p>simple example but for example if</p>
<p>there's a opportunity management where</p>
<p>we're going to capture um opportunities</p>
<p>we might decide to have bid committees</p>
<p>we can create quotes we can send it for</p>
<p>technical adjudication there's credit</p>
<p>checks and all sorts of things that can</p>
<p>be done you don't have to draw the flow</p>
<p>diagram because this can happen in any</p>
<p>sequence this we refer to as a process</p>
<p>container so there's a container and I</p>
<p>can add new process elements to this in</p>
<p>order to cater for my requirements so as</p>
<p>you can see there's no predefined flow</p>
<p>set up you can include some rules to</p>
<p>make sure that there are certain flows</p>
<p>that are enforced in certain conditions</p>
<p>and that is an aspect which uh which is</p>
<p>driven by the dynamic side so even a a</p>
<p>controlled process is a specific case of</p>
<p>a dynamic process where certain rules</p>
<p>are applied so unstructured process</p>
<p>means from intelligent business</p>
<p>operations point of view it means we've</p>
<p>moved on from workflow where we have</p>
<p>workflow based tools that have a</p>
<p>predefined routing because because of my</p>
<p>my contextual knowledge I know that I</p>
<p>may want to send it to a bid Committee</p>
<p>in certain instances it will force me to</p>
<p>send it to bid committee and I'll touch</p>
<p>on some of those rules the benefits of</p>
<p>this is it's actually less costly and</p>
<p>more adaptive to build this so as soon</p>
<p>as you discover new</p>
<p>requirements it's quite easy to adapt</p>
<p>you don't have to get it's it's not so</p>
<p>when you've got a pre-built and a</p>
<p>complex workflow um set up in order to</p>
<p>change it is actually quite costly with</p>
<p>this uh approach that we have around</p>
<p>constructed processes it's actually</p>
<p>quite easy we can drag another or drop</p>
<p>another activity into the process</p>
<p>container and very quickly expose that</p>
<p>to the business users at a very low cost</p>
<p>the other thing is you spend less time</p>
<p>designing and more time doing we find we</p>
<p>find there's a big resistance in trying</p>
<p>to get to the 100% process people don't</p>
<p>get to that point um you can spend a lot</p>
<p>of time what we call analysis paralysis</p>
<p>so you can spend a lot of time trying to</p>
<p>get the 100% model and by the time that</p>
<p>you that you actually get to run it and</p>
<p>automate it that it's actually um uh out</p>
<p>of um out of date so with this approach</p>
<p>the benefit is that you can spend less</p>
<p>time designing and more time doing so</p>
<p>it's a lot more of an agile approach</p>
<p>we'll take what we have and we can start</p>
<p>we don't have to wait to get the perfect</p>
<p>uh the perfect process because we will</p>
<p>never get there and it also takes away</p>
<p>that that fear of analysis paralysis we</p>
<p>can experiment we can we it gives us a</p>
<p>lot more from a business perspective a</p>
<p>lot more agility and a lot less um</p>
<p>effort required to actually get started</p>
<p>because we don't have to think about</p>
<p>what the process is exactly going to</p>
<p>look like what we can do once we've got</p>
<p>it working is we can actually analyze</p>
<p>the data and look at how many times</p>
<p>didn't did it follow us certain path now</p>
<p>that is something that I'll touch on a</p>
<p>bit later in the presentation when I</p>
<p>show you some examples but this we can</p>
<p>now use um to come up with what we think</p>
<p>the next best action would be for</p>
<p>example so the reason why um one of the</p>
<p>key um other benefits of of um knowledge</p>
<p>style of this um unstructured processes</p>
<p>in a knowledge style work is</p>
<p>traditionally when you do knowledge</p>
<p>style work what we mean by knowledge</p>
<p>Style is I don't I don't want to follow</p>
<p>the workflow because I know it's not</p>
<p>going to work so that's how I always</p>
<p>typify what a what a knowledge style</p>
<p>worker will say when they look at a</p>
<p>process we now give them the option to</p>
<p>Route it any which way they want the</p>
<p>advantage is that we still have a audit</p>
<p>trial in in place so we can still see</p>
<p>that process as part of a audit trial we</p>
<p>can still see what decisions were made</p>
<p>even though we didn't force the route</p>
<p>that they needed to go down a critical</p>
<p>element which is missing from from um</p>
<p>most processes right now if you have</p>
<p>unstructured processes in your business</p>
<p>um that happen via email it happens via</p>
<p>um um Word documents spreadsheets and</p>
<p>all sorts of things that that um that go</p>
<p>around because structured workflow</p>
<p>doesn't cater for the requirement the</p>
<p>flexibility the problem is that you have</p>
<p>no order Trails a part of that great</p>
<p>examples are things like customer</p>
<p>service a case style where you've got um</p>
<p>where you've got a audit traal of of of</p>
<p>a customer service um request the thing</p>
<p>is it can go to to a number of people be</p>
<p>handle in in a number of ways and it's</p>
<p>critically important that you have a</p>
<p>order tral of that knowledge style work</p>
<p>that goes with it if you've got adoc</p>
<p>data entry in a complex environment and</p>
<p>I'll show you example of of that uh in</p>
<p>the next screen where there's you don't</p>
<p>have um you can't determine what data</p>
<p>you're going to get next you once again</p>
<p>it's a customer</p>
<p>environment and there's just a lot of</p>
<p>data that needs to go into into um into</p>
<p>the initial part of a process and it can</p>
<p>come from anytime any place</p>
<p>anywhere the other the other um example</p>
<p>of where information can come from and</p>
<p>what you need to do with it is for</p>
<p>example social listening and once again</p>
<p>if you look at our social listening um</p>
<p>webinar you'll see this in action where</p>
<p>you can actually listen for tweets for</p>
<p>example for Twitter that's all around um</p>
<p>examples in your business and now you</p>
<p>can route the response to that whether</p>
<p>you retweet whether it goes off to</p>
<p>customer service whether it goes off to</p>
<p>marketing whether it goes off to uh</p>
<p>public relations or uh and if we have to</p>
<p>add more people we can actually we can</p>
<p>actually handle that um on a Case by</p>
<p>case basis so unstructured processes</p>
<p>have a very strong case um approach to</p>
<p>them as well so you almost handle it on</p>
<p>a Case by case basis the rules change</p>
<p>Case by case and social listening is is</p>
<p>is one of those now I I mention the the</p>
<p>data entry example this for example is a</p>
<p>a complex data entry environment</p>
<p>where um the process to capture the</p>
<p>information in in from a funeral</p>
<p>Arrangement um or arrangers point of</p>
<p>view now there's a lot of information</p>
<p>that they need to get around funeral</p>
<p>options um obviously they sell</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>um inventory items to to the family they</p>
<p>need to do uh specific Arrangements</p>
<p>around cars viewing there's there's a</p>
<p>whole lot of things that need to be done</p>
<p>with that the challenge that you have is</p>
<p>you don't get the information in a nice</p>
<p>sequential uh um sequence uh it really</p>
<p>comes to you over a two or three day</p>
<p>period in a very spec in a very erratic</p>
<p>and and adog manner you need to have the</p>
<p>ability to to capture that at some point</p>
<p>in time you need to run a rule and say</p>
<p>do I have everything that I need um to</p>
<p>to uh uh to move this on in in terms of</p>
<p>the process or is there still some</p>
<p>information outstanding so some of the</p>
<p>fields are required in order for this</p>
<p>process to actually uh move forward but</p>
<p>it gives as you can see there's a whole</p>
<p>number of options here now these are all</p>
<p>independent activities that that uh um</p>
<p>that we can choose at any point in time</p>
<p>to actually route the work to so we call</p>
<p>we the way that we can add those so if</p>
<p>we just add a new container if we need a</p>
<p>new step in here we can add it in here</p>
<p>with what we call our Dynamic allocation</p>
<p>logic a very simple and easy way to uh</p>
<p>add processes to XM Pro um dynamically</p>
<p>example of the Twitter feed I'm not</p>
<p>going to go through the the whole</p>
<p>example again but in this instance we</p>
<p>were listening for Quantas um when they</p>
<p>had some issues and there's certain</p>
<p>things that you can do it can be PR</p>
<p>ction can be bookings now the nice thing</p>
<p>is once again we have a full order trial</p>
<p>of um so we pick up the tweet and then</p>
<p>we have a response to that there can be</p>
<p>multiple outcomes to that so that is a</p>
<p>typically a typical unstructured process</p>
<p>because it still relies on a knowledge</p>
<p>worker to read the message and decide</p>
<p>what to do there's no there's no in</p>
<p>there's no automatic routing or</p>
<p>artificial intelligence built into this</p>
<p>um intelligent business operations are</p>
<p>really there to support knowledge</p>
<p>workers to actually get better at um at</p>
<p>doing this and that was the example of</p>
<p>of</p>
<p>Twitter so if we look at Dynamic</p>
<p>processes as I said structured</p>
<p>unstructured processes and dynamic</p>
<p>processes actually differ to some degree</p>
<p>um dynamically uh Dynamic processes</p>
<p>imply that that they that they</p>
<p>dynamically change based on um certain</p>
<p>events that occur and I'll address some</p>
<p>of those events</p>
<p>uh in a minute or so these these Dynamic</p>
<p>processes are also context aware so they</p>
<p>know what goes on around them and I'll</p>
<p>show you some or explain some examples</p>
<p>of what context aware means and then</p>
<p>lastly they've got built-in Predictive</p>
<p>Analytics and what that means is it'll</p>
<p>actually show you information that will</p>
<p>help you make better decisions and</p>
<p>sometimes based on that analytics it</p>
<p>will actually dynamically change some of</p>
<p>the routing options and steps that are</p>
<p>available so if we look</p>
<p>at um processes that change dynamically</p>
<p>based on events example of that is</p>
<p>um there's and I'm going to put all</p>
<p>three of them just so that we have all</p>
<p>of them so when we say they can change</p>
<p>on events there are a couple events that</p>
<p>can impact</p>
<p>um these changes one of them are data</p>
<p>rules</p>
<p>events so we can check how close are we</p>
<p>to to our our um budget and as soon as</p>
<p>we get to within a certain percentage of</p>
<p>our budget so we've spent 80% of budget</p>
<p>on a general ledger code then we can</p>
<p>introduce an additional approval step</p>
<p>automatically so it'll Auto it will</p>
<p>dynamically change Based on data rules</p>
<p>there's certain business rules um that</p>
<p>we may have as well so if you've got a</p>
<p>complex um approval Matrix it can</p>
<p>dynamically change</p>
<p>processes are context aware what we mean</p>
<p>by that is what happens if exchange rate</p>
<p>changes well if the exchange rate</p>
<p>changes by more than 10% we will want uh</p>
<p>we need to we need to introduce an</p>
<p>additional approval step on all all</p>
<p>purchase orders um from overse or we</p>
<p>need to automatically introduce a a</p>
<p>activity that will always make sure that</p>
<p>we buy a forward cover um context to we</p>
<p>so for example if there was a storm a</p>
<p>massive storm in a certain area um</p>
<p>geographical area we may want to say we</p>
<p>need to change because we're going to</p>
<p>have a huge influx of calls into the</p>
<p>insurance call center we actually want</p>
<p>to take a 10-step process and turn it</p>
<p>into three just to get the volumes</p>
<p>through quicker and you can have and you</p>
<p>can change the the approval rules based</p>
<p>on something like that so processes are</p>
<p>a lot more context aware for example and</p>
<p>then lastly what happens um for example</p>
<p>also what happens if the oil price</p>
<p>changes it may have uh a certain impact</p>
<p>now you can you can listen for those</p>
<p>they are web services and as soon as I</p>
<p>need to do a step I can actually go and</p>
<p>look at what the web patterns are and</p>
<p>these are just examples of things the</p>
<p>context can also be who's doing the</p>
<p>transaction so for example if it's the</p>
<p>the CEO of organization there's one step</p>
<p>in the approval or um yes it always gets</p>
<p>approved or whatever the case might be</p>
<p>um so it can also it's also aware around</p>
<p>who's doing the transaction and based on</p>
<p>that um it can it can change the routing</p>
<p>the logic the rules the appr approval uh</p>
<p>limits and everything that goes with it</p>
<p>or even what is displayed on the screen</p>
<p>so Dynamic process is a lot more context</p>
<p>way and then lastly they've got built-in</p>
<p>Predictive Analytics so you can have a</p>
<p>graph in the approval form and I'm going</p>
<p>to show you example of that you can add</p>
<p>additional steps to that approval based</p>
<p>on a threshold so for example if I find</p>
<p>that I'm within 80% of my budget um it</p>
<p>can automatically add another step to</p>
<p>that it can also advise me on what we</p>
<p>call what is the next best action so the</p>
<p>Predictive Analytics because we don't</p>
<p>have a predefined routing we just have</p>
<p>this container with five or six</p>
<p>activities sitting in there we may want</p>
<p>to know well what did the guys before me</p>
<p>do that how or what is the what is the</p>
<p>happy path what is the 80% rule um</p>
<p>around what the next step um should</p>
<p>be for me Predictive Analytics the the</p>
<p>best way that was described is that um</p>
<p>dashboards are rear viiew mirrors you</p>
<p>can see what happened in the past with</p>
<p>Predictive Analytics we actually want to</p>
<p>see what is coming and what</p>
<p>is uh ahead of us so the nice thing is</p>
<p>they can give us inflight analytics so</p>
<p>instead of having dashboard where we</p>
<p>look back we can see where are we right</p>
<p>now so I'm sitting at my it's like a GPS</p>
<p>the analogy that Janelle Hill um at</p>
<p>Gartner used was it's like sitting with</p>
<p>the GPS I can see around me I can see</p>
<p>and I can and I can determine um the</p>
<p>context of where I am so I've got</p>
<p>inflight analytics uh and it gives me</p>
<p>and the nice the you can also do</p>
<p>real-time process Discovery so we can</p>
<p>say once again where are we um uh or we</p>
<p>can analyze when I'm in the activity I</p>
<p>can analyze all the previous instances</p>
<p>of that activity and I can say well what</p>
<p>was the what was the next best action</p>
<p>that most people took out of that so</p>
<p>process Discovery is just is just mining</p>
<p>the existing process data and we'll</p>
<p>we'll publish some some documents and</p>
<p>white papers around these Concepts so</p>
<p>lastly before I just quickly go into the</p>
<p>software to show you is that um at</p>
<p>Gartner they were also saying where will</p>
<p>B BPM be in 2020 they will have</p>
<p>unstructured processes they will support</p>
<p>Dynamic BPM they there will be um social</p>
<p>BP uh it will support social BPM there</p>
<p>will be context tow it will support</p>
<p>organizational liquidity which is just a</p>
<p>fancy name for change management but in</p>
<p>the end it's all around intelligent</p>
<p>business operations so let me give you</p>
<p>example of what you can get right now in</p>
<p>2011 um you don't have to wait till 2020</p>
<p>to see some of the stuff in action me</p>
<p>just so I'm just going and I'm just</p>
<p>going quickly going to log into</p>
<p>XM oh come</p>
<p>on great so I'm Tim Clark I'm the second</p>
<p>person someone else put in a requisition</p>
<p>I'm not going to take you through the</p>
<p>whole workflow in terms of how you how</p>
<p>you put in requisitions but essentially</p>
<p>someone started a a new task to to have</p>
<p>a process and in my to-do list under my</p>
<p>cases you will see that I have um under</p>
<p>procurement under my under my task list</p>
<p>there's a purchase requisition from</p>
<p>Keith that I need to approve when I look</p>
<p>at Keith and this is a simplified</p>
<p>example of of um typically what this can</p>
<p>do but as you can see we've got a case</p>
<p>File uh where we store all the documents</p>
<p>as they come through as part of the</p>
<p>process</p>
<p>um these are the dynamic activities so I</p>
<p>can add more activities right now uh</p>
<p>there's I can either just approve it or</p>
<p>decline it or I can send it for</p>
<p>technical approval it might be that</p>
<p>we're buying it um I'm not sure why</p>
<p>they're buying um new bikes for two the</p>
<p>France in it but that doesn't matter um</p>
<p>so I might just send it for technical</p>
<p>adjudication um</p>
<p>and the great thing that you can see</p>
<p>here is that we've actually embedded</p>
<p>analytics or inflight analytics so I</p>
<p>don't have to go off to my Erp I can see</p>
<p>what budget do I have</p>
<p>available how much has actually been</p>
<p>spent how much have we previously</p>
<p>committed to this process and how much</p>
<p>has Keith previously requested so you</p>
<p>can build these graphs any which way</p>
<p>that you want out of external data So</p>
<p>based on this I can now make a decision</p>
<p>on what I want to do looking at this um</p>
<p>I'm still not sure what I want to do so</p>
<p>I can say well please advise me on the</p>
<p>next best action so I can see that of</p>
<p>the last almost 200 processes that went</p>
<p>through this activities 145 of them were</p>
<p>actually just approved from here so this</p>
<p>gives me an analysis of what everyone</p>
<p>else before we did and it gives me</p>
<p>indication if I didn't know what the</p>
<p>next best action is now obviously this</p>
<p>is a very simplif example of this you</p>
<p>can also take these dashboards and go</p>
<p>and build right at the top here and</p>
<p>we'll publish some some some examples of</p>
<p>that um on our website where you can</p>
<p>build your your process goal dashboard</p>
<p>so I can have three</p>
<p>um graphs up there showing me my process</p>
<p>goals in terms of where are what is my</p>
<p>what is my monthly budget um what are</p>
<p>the actual</p>
<p>um actual expenditure and everything to</p>
<p>date now now this looks like it's a it's</p>
<p>quite complex to do it it really isn't</p>
<p>so this is the back end where we design</p>
<p>processes I'm not going to show you how</p>
<p>to design processes what I'm going to</p>
<p>show you is how easy it is to set up a</p>
<p>chart so I can choose um in that</p>
<p>instance just this this is the one for</p>
<p>the budget so I'm just going to open</p>
<p>that and I can choose the layout the</p>
<p>look feel colors and everything that I</p>
<p>need for my chart all the in terms of</p>
<p>properties and whatever it explains on</p>
<p>the screen so the budget goal the</p>
<p>wording everything that you want to make</p>
<p>it easy for people to understand how</p>
<p>processes work so in this instance you</p>
<p>can have your</p>
<p>Dynamic sorry you can have your</p>
<p>unstructured</p>
<p>processes um it's got the built-in</p>
<p>Dynamic and if you look at our social um</p>
<p>our social listening uh webinar you'll</p>
<p>see that we've got extensive support for</p>
<p>the social processes so in terms of what</p>
<p>intelligent business operations mean</p>
<p>right now X and pro can give you the</p>
<p>structured processes um that makes it</p>
<p>quick to deploy you don't have to um</p>
<p>that's highly adaptive um it can the the</p>
<p>processes can adapt based on the rules</p>
<p>so if for example I am now at 80% of my</p>
<p>budget I I can have another button</p>
<p>appear here or I can change that button</p>
<p>to to become executive approval um so I</p>
<p>can so I can change dynamically change</p>
<p>the process based on some of these rules</p>
<p>here that is a really powerful concept</p>
<p>for something like um expense control</p>
<p>where you would want the closer you get</p>
<p>to this budget line that the rules</p>
<p>change and then lastly we can we can</p>
<p>also introduce um discussions and and</p>
<p>the social aspect of U BPM thank you for</p>
<p>watching this I really appreciate that</p>
<p>um I'm trying to keep it as short as</p>
<p>possible and show you as much as we can</p>
<p>um around the future and one We Believe</p>
<p>business Process Management moving to</p>
<p>intelligent business operations can be</p>
<p>achieved right now thank you very</p>
<p>much</p>
