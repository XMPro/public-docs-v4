<summary>Transcript</summary>pick some fruit flies across the broad
<p>range of roles and organizations but we</p>
<p>find that those who are really</p>
<p>responsible for the operational outcomes</p>
<p>operations manager service delivery</p>
<p>managers project managers people that</p>
<p>the operational role are the biggest</p>
<p>beneficiaries of this day they the ones</p>
<p>dealing with the unpredictability or the</p>
<p>uncertainty and they still have to make</p>
<p>sure that the operations in GP outcome</p>
<p>so they gave the eyes for business and</p>
<p>they need to make sure that we make as</p>
<p>many widgets create as many people and</p>
<p>there's many more wages as we need to as</p>
<p>we need to process and I work in this</p>
<p>unstructured war for them what keeps</p>
<p>them awake at night is this is really</p>
<p>how do I control the handler manager and</p>
<p>how do I manage the productivity from</p>
<p>operations for you and now that your</p>
<p>productivity smudges deficiency or our</p>
<p>fast videos but are we doing it right</p>
<p>the effectiveness so their productivity</p>
<p>measures of efficiency and effectiveness</p>
<p>and Israeli what it's improved ability</p>
<p>to make sure that we get control of</p>
<p>those unpredictable processes and once</p>
<p>we have control we can make sure that we</p>
<p>do the movie about that suits see how</p>
<p>service delivery manages and</p>
<p>managers and that's the key business</p>
<p>issues that we see see how those are the</p>
<p>ones that need to put in a beam</p>
<p>technology so it's not good operations</p>
<p>going to do all of it and you don't have</p>
<p>been a beam technology so the rather the</p>
<p>CIO and we see it is that they should</p>
<p>identify one of one of the best</p>
<p>solutions are they to solve that</p>
<p>specific business challenge and in the</p>
<p>season the business challenge is</p>
<p>handling unpredictability series is that</p>
<p>a really great job of putting it all the</p>
<p>line of business applications we it does</p>
<p>the back office where does all the</p>
<p>transactional stuff but the CRN's the</p>
<p>geography is the banking back office</p>
<p>systems all of those are the NCI is a</p>
<p>very really good gross of that I've done</p>
<p>a great job that the next body to enable</p>
<p>as not in workers and those people make</p>
<p>decisions with the right decision</p>
<p>support tools and also whether I crisis</p>
<p>management tools to get operations get</p>
<p>the maximum element in our experience</p>
<p>the bigger they are the more problems</p>
<p>they have the more uncertainty you have</p>
<p>the more unpredictability you have 10</p>
<p>people in your organization you probably</p>
<p>have a lot more control when you have</p>
<p>10,000 people in the organization a real</p>
<p>benefit reason these processes are not</p>
<p>hard with you in person organization all</p>
<p>right I think darling</p>
<p>the complexity lies with all the</p>
<p>variations of combinations the way that</p>
<p>you on board someone that why does she</p>
<p>do operations fundamentally doesn't</p>
<p>really differ and a high level between</p>
<p>you give you the fans actual details</p>
<p>that the complexity gets introduced as</p>
<p>soon as you have a broad number of</p>
<p>improvements so I travel experience</p>
<p>claims in their small business follows</p>
<p>exacting rappers what I've done in a</p>
<p>really large organizations is just so</p>
<p>many variations and exceptions in a</p>
<p>large organization okay you need to like</p>
<p>X and practicing for the certified</p>
<p>organizations the larger they are the</p>
<p>more the more challenges that have</p>
<p>around unpredictability and water</p>
