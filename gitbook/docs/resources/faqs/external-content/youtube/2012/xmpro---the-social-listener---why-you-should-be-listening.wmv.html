<summary>Transcript</summary>great thank you for joining us for this
<p>uh webinar I'm not sure that we'll um</p>
<p>use an hour of your time but um</p>
<p>hopefully what we're going to show you</p>
<p>today is new and Innovative in the um</p>
<p>social BPM space the social BPM world so</p>
<p>it's all about um what is social BPM and</p>
<p>why should you care we're only going to</p>
<p>look at one aspect of social BPM today</p>
<p>there's there's a number of components</p>
<p>to social BPM it's all around how do you</p>
<p>work in the process space where um</p>
<p>there's conversation either internal</p>
<p>external whatever the case might be uh</p>
<p>right now with a social listener today</p>
<p>we're going to show you one example of</p>
<p>how you can use x and proo in your</p>
<p>business to enhance social BPM so the</p>
<p>topic of today is what is social BPM and</p>
<p>why should you care so I thought just</p>
<p>before we go into showing you uh how we</p>
<p>do it in XM proos just to give you some</p>
<p>some background to the reason why we</p>
<p>build this listener and um what our</p>
<p>objective with it is I'm just going to</p>
<p>jump into some of</p>
<p>the so I'm just getting my keyboard</p>
<p>here</p>
<p>cool so um in terms of of of social be</p>
<p>M there's a couple of it's it's quite a</p>
<p>large area and um if you listen to</p>
<p>Gartner um at the recent Garden it Expo</p>
<p>where where we were listening to</p>
<p>analysts like Jim siner Elise aling</p>
<p>there's are there's there's a lot</p>
<p>happening around integrating social</p>
<p>conversations into the BPM world or</p>
<p>business Process Management World</p>
<p>workflow world or whatever you want to</p>
<p>call that so uh some of the the the the</p>
<p>areas that they cover or where where</p>
<p>they see the the benefit and advantage</p>
<p>of social BPM is when uh we talk about</p>
<p>process Improvement so this this is</p>
<p>collaborative design where there's a</p>
<p>whole lot of people and we we actually</p>
<p>use to tools and Technology to to help</p>
<p>with um how do we make the process</p>
<p>better so that's one area of social BPM</p>
<p>the other one is when we have</p>
<p>discussions inside the transaction so</p>
<p>when a transaction or a workflow is</p>
<p>happening a process is is happening</p>
<p>um that there's actually conversations</p>
<p>and discussions going on which</p>
<p>traditionally was done by email or a</p>
<p>whole number of other communication</p>
<p>channels um that that is now brought</p>
<p>into the social BPM sphere as well and</p>
<p>then the other one is when there are</p>
<p>people talking to others on social</p>
<p>networking sites and that's the one that</p>
<p>we're going to focus on today so social</p>
<p>BPM is quite a large area in the BPM uh</p>
<p>uh BPM space</p>
<p>today we're just going to focus on on</p>
<p>the social networking sites how how do</p>
<p>we actually integrate some of those</p>
<p>conversations that might be external to</p>
<p>our organization and they don't have to</p>
<p>be in actual fact if you use tools like</p>
<p>yamama social card things like that</p>
<p>there's a lot of conversations</p>
<p>internally in</p>
<p>organizations that</p>
<p>um that uh sorry there's um just some</p>
<p>questions coming in um so you you can</p>
<p>use tools like um social uh social cost</p>
<p>Yama those sort of things to monitor</p>
<p>internal as well today we're going to</p>
<p>talk a little bit about out outward</p>
<p>facing um processes where we actually</p>
<p>want to monitor some of the discussions</p>
<p>that happen or conversation that people</p>
<p>have um around us on on these social</p>
<p>networking sites and the best example of</p>
<p>what this means is actually something</p>
<p>that John Hayes the chief marketing</p>
<p>officer of American Express said where</p>
<p>he said consumers are in the midst of a</p>
<p>convers ation that isn't ours the race</p>
<p>is on to grow ears to listen to what</p>
<p>they are saying to me that encompasses</p>
<p>everything that we're trying to do with</p>
<p>the social listener and trying to</p>
<p>integrate that into how we do business</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>um there's a whole lot of conversations</p>
<p>going on around uh us our competitors</p>
<p>Our Brands or whatever the case might be</p>
<p>and to grow ears to learn what they are</p>
<p>saying is actually a great way of</p>
<p>describing what this social listener</p>
<p>does I thought that was a very apt</p>
<p>description so the image that we've got</p>
<p>here of the of the of the water cooler</p>
<p>Um this can be internal to organization</p>
<p>or external there are conversations</p>
<p>happening right this moment around your</p>
<p>business your product your um your</p>
<p>competitors the market space that you're</p>
<p>in that right now you are not privy to</p>
<p>that you don't um actively or that</p>
<p>you're not actively involved in but you</p>
<p>have the ability to to to capture some</p>
<p>of those conversations and and start</p>
<p>using it in your business and that's the</p>
<p>value that we'd like to show you</p>
<p>today so when we look at social</p>
<p>networking I just quickly had a look at</p>
<p>Wikipedia um the whole social media</p>
<p>social networking sit um and what</p>
<p>technically what it is it's just</p>
<p>webbased and mobile technology that turn</p>
<p>communication into an interactive</p>
<p>dialogue and once again to me those are</p>
<p>the the critical components the fact</p>
<p>that it in that it's Interactive</p>
<p>a lot of companies don't interact now</p>
<p>it's one way communication there's a</p>
<p>whole lot of people using these</p>
<p>web-based and mobile technologies to</p>
<p>have conversations to each other and</p>
<p>they also have conversations around your</p>
<p>business and your products and uh the</p>
<p>idea is to become interactive into that</p>
<p>to actually interject yourself into that</p>
<p>com uh that part of the communication</p>
<p>and either grab hold of some of them</p>
<p>manage some of them or use the</p>
<p>opportunity for for some of them so if</p>
<p>we look at what the social networking</p>
<p>thing means I think a lot of people</p>
<p>think it's just people talking about</p>
<p>themselves what did I have for breakfast</p>
<p>what time am I dropping off the kids um</p>
<p>know just all all of the personal stuff</p>
<p>that gets shared on sites like Twitter</p>
<p>Facebook um and all the social</p>
<p>networking sites those are probably the</p>
<p>two biggest when when it when it's all</p>
<p>around what am I doing then there's some</p>
<p>conversations around business talking</p>
<p>about themselves</p>
<p>so um businesses currently use social</p>
<p>networking sites uh Facebook pages</p>
<p>Google+ Pages um Twitter accounts all</p>
<p>sorts of things once again to</p>
<p>communicate out to to users uh or or to</p>
<p>to to Consumers and customers and uh</p>
<p>even internally to employees to to to</p>
<p>tell them what they're doing to to talk</p>
<p>about themselves but the more critical</p>
<p>one for me right now is actually people</p>
<p>talking about businesses so so when</p>
<p>someone is having a conversation about</p>
<p>you um to someone else using this this</p>
<p>new Communication channel uh or or and</p>
<p>actual fact this whole platform or or</p>
<p>whole array of of communication channels</p>
<p>that they currently use to talk about</p>
<p>you um and have discussions around your</p>
<p>customer service your competitors the</p>
<p>pricing um and maybe some some</p>
<p>opportunities that are out there uh as</p>
<p>well around your business so that is</p>
<p>probably the the the area that um that</p>
<p>at the moment gets the least attention</p>
<p>but it's got the biggest impact so if we</p>
<p>look at people talking about themselves</p>
<p>I just want to take a minute and and</p>
<p>just look at um typically what that</p>
<p>means and for those of you who who know</p>
<p>Twitter very well and know exactly how</p>
<p>it works um I'm just going to quickly</p>
<p>give uh the people who don't know that</p>
<p>um just a little bit of a</p>
<p>of a of</p>
<p>a overview on</p>
<p>um on actually what something like</p>
<p>Twitter is so if we take the famous Mr</p>
<p>Ashton kusher who is currently in Two</p>
<p>and a Half Men and he's also ex Mr U</p>
<p>Demi mu</p>
<p>or um there's a lot of conversations</p>
<p>that he's having with people now the</p>
<p>interesting thing is he's got 8 and a</p>
<p>half million followers worldwide so</p>
<p>whatever Ashton says eight and a half</p>
<p>people get eight and a half million</p>
<p>people get onto their on um on their</p>
<p>version of this form</p>
<p>um in actual fact there's something I</p>
<p>want to</p>
<p>do just before I um I actually want to</p>
<p>open up my Twitter account and actually</p>
<p>just go and quickly write something</p>
<p>about this so I'm going to go into here</p>
<p>and say Ash XM</p>
<p>Pro</p>
<p>great</p>
<p>and I'll show you the reason why I'm</p>
<p>doing this great</p>
<p>webinar</p>
<p>on social</p>
<p>media</p>
<p>right now so I'm just going to tweet</p>
<p>that and go back</p>
<p>to Mr Ashen Kusha who's got a lot more</p>
<p>followers than me um but some of the</p>
<p>things that you'll see here he's got 8</p>
<p>and a half million people the way that</p>
<p>you address him is using the AD Sign and</p>
<p>and and once again this is just a quick</p>
<p>101 on Twitter for because we're going</p>
<p>to use some of these examples um as we</p>
<p>as we look at the XM Pro social</p>
<p>listeners so the that means it's just</p>
<p>really to identify uh his username so</p>
<p>whenever there's a ad so whenever he</p>
<p>addresses someone back he'll use the ad</p>
<p>you can retweet so if you look at this</p>
<p>example he just made a comment here</p>
<p>around a music track on Spotify</p>
<p>um by this artist now there's 8 and a</p>
<p>half million people seeing that so it's</p>
<p>got a huge impact in terms of brand I'm</p>
<p>not sure how much they pay him to do</p>
<p>this if they if they do um but but you</p>
<p>can see in some of the conversations</p>
<p>that is happening there's Amazon now I</p>
<p>thought this one was pretty good um you</p>
<p>need something for your Christmas</p>
<p>shopping ideas may I suggest a yodling</p>
<p>pickle now I've never ever seen a</p>
<p>yodling pickle but I can tell you there</p>
<p>are thousand there are probably there</p>
<p>probably hundreds of thousands of people</p>
<p>going to Amazon to have a look at a</p>
<p>yodling pickle so this is the massive</p>
<p>impact that something like social</p>
<p>conversations can have if you're not to</p>
<p>on top of that social conversation just</p>
<p>imagine what the impact would be if</p>
<p>someone like Ashton mentioned your</p>
<p>product and you didn't even know about</p>
<p>it you would have a flat of traffic you</p>
<p>you'd have no um so how do you</p>
<p>anticipate if you're in that space if</p>
<p>you're in this retail space how do you</p>
<p>anticipate the influx of demand that's</p>
<p>going to have on your first place your</p>
<p>web servers um and maybe if you do sell</p>
<p>um a lot of these yodling pickles in</p>
<p>terms of your stockholding all of that</p>
<p>just one one tweet from someone like</p>
<p>Ashton can have a massive impact in in</p>
<p>organization um in terms of their</p>
<p>backend so that that's some of the</p>
<p>reasons why we'd like to to do um some</p>
<p>of the monitoring and listening and</p>
<p>actively turning that into into</p>
<p>processes so as you can see um the the</p>
<p>hashtag is used just almost as a search</p>
<p>um as a search tag so if you've got any</p>
<p>specific keyword that you would like um</p>
<p>to start gaining momentum on on on</p>
<p>Twitter um we use um and in actual fact</p>
<p>we we we'd love you to use hash XM Pro</p>
<p>um for for anything that that that you</p>
<p>discuss uh but if you if you want to tag</p>
<p>anything if you want to so in terms of</p>
<p>search and finding stuff on Twitter it's</p>
<p>actually not that hard yeah</p>
<p>you don't have to have the the hashtag</p>
<p>but if the hashtag is there it's it's a</p>
<p>very quick way um to identify things</p>
<p>that you want to to to um to create as</p>
<p>as as searchable words and so and you</p>
<p>will probably Now find that there are</p>
<p>hundreds of thousands of of of people</p>
<p>using the hash</p>
<p>Christmas um for ideas so if you were a</p>
<p>retailer you could actually monitor hash</p>
<p>Christmas for some of your product</p>
<p>mentions and and and see if there's any</p>
<p>activity around that so that is</p>
<p>essentially what a personal um user</p>
<p>would use they would write all sorts of</p>
<p>things some of them might be um his</p>
<p>interest in y yodling um pickles there's</p>
<p>um there's some most of the stuff that</p>
<p>he does is actually around the community</p>
<p>social um and uh but but as you can see</p>
<p>he's got a he's got a huge amount of</p>
<p>following and</p>
<p>um a massive it can have a massive</p>
<p>impact on on a brand for example if it's</p>
<p>mentioned by him so just uh very quickly</p>
<p>again so that is how you would have the</p>
<p>username identified this is how you</p>
<p>would have search tags identified and</p>
<p>then uh what a lot of people do is they</p>
<p>just retweet or you can reply and you</p>
<p>can also send direct messages I'm not</p>
<p>sure that Ashton is going to reply to</p>
<p>your direct me uh message but that is</p>
<p>essentially um what uh what a personal</p>
<p>user would use if if you're looking at a</p>
<p>business talking about themselves so</p>
<p>that's not a personal uh uh Twitter</p>
<p>account and someone talking about</p>
<p>themselves if I look at a at a at a</p>
<p>personal sorry at a business one if I</p>
<p>look at Quantas and the reason why I'm</p>
<p>using Quantas right now in Australia</p>
<p>Quantas is in all the headlines all the</p>
<p>time they've had major issues or um they</p>
<p>actually grounded their their whole</p>
<p>Fleet worldwide on a Saturday morning</p>
<p>and caused millions of people to tweet</p>
<p>because they actually couldn't get</p>
<p>through to um to their help desk they gr</p>
<p>they grounded the the whole worldwide</p>
<p>Fleet due to Industrial action at the</p>
<p>moment um they that they have very</p>
<p>high-profile company and that's why I</p>
<p>decided to use them this is not about</p>
<p>that this is not about um right now if</p>
<p>you have issues you can actually follow</p>
<p>that I had a dedicated Twitter account</p>
<p>so as you can see at qf um uh customer</p>
<p>care is actually what they currently</p>
<p>just use um at the moment challenge that</p>
<p>they have is it's only online in</p>
<p>Australian time so if I'm stuck stuck in</p>
<p>the US I still have a I still have a</p>
<p>problem um but this is typically what a</p>
<p>company would use to talk about</p>
<p>themselves this is exactly what we have</p>
<p>as X and pro we have X and pro one which</p>
<p>we which we um talk about</p>
<p>ourselves the the real challenge come in</p>
<p>when people are talking about your</p>
<p>business so if I look at Quantas again</p>
<p>and I go and search that Quantas hashtag</p>
<p>so the Quant search for you will see</p>
<p>there's a couple of people that have now</p>
<p>been that that are complaining because</p>
<p>they've been there for 30 minutes the</p>
<p>bags are not there um Karen Ferris is</p>
<p>saying it's the worst experience with</p>
<p>Quantas after 13 years now this is</p>
<p>someone that you would not like to go</p>
<p>and talk about that this is a loyal</p>
<p>customer who's been around for 13 years</p>
<p>um around the Quantas brand and now</p>
<p>she's really upset now knowing Airlines</p>
<p>there there might be other reasons and</p>
<p>and I must the reason the other reason</p>
<p>why I'm using Quantas is they are</p>
<p>actually quite proactive in following</p>
<p>this up you can actually see that</p>
<p>they've got a whole lot of Twitter</p>
<p>accounts and things that they use to</p>
<p>manage um some of this and they do</p>
<p>respond and they do have a team that</p>
<p>follow up on this but it just gives you</p>
<p>uh a view and this actually um I just</p>
<p>use the exm pro account so we have one</p>
<p>as well um you can go and sign up and</p>
<p>follow us on um hash sorry at XM Pro you</p>
<p>can you can find us there um but this is</p>
<p>really just to show the conversations</p>
<p>that are that are happening around your</p>
<p>brand and your business and these are</p>
<p>the ones that are critical that you may</p>
<p>want to monitor or or pick up on now</p>
<p>that was just for Twitter the challenge</p>
<p>that you have is that there's Twitter</p>
<p>there's Facebook there's YouTube there's</p>
<p>RSS feeds there's LinkedIn and there's</p>
<p>even emails and things that may come</p>
<p>into support so there's a whole there's</p>
<p>a multitude of channels where all this</p>
<p>information come in and it's really hard</p>
<p>to have a on it so what happens in most</p>
<p>organizations is that they Implement</p>
<p>what they call social media monitoring</p>
<p>so they they start listening for these</p>
<p>keywords like on us they would listen</p>
<p>for these keywords Brands usernames all</p>
<p>sorts of things like that and there are</p>
<p>quite a lot of monitoring tools out</p>
<p>there things that will listen for you so</p>
<p>it'll pick these things up um and a lot</p>
<p>of marketing but what happens in most</p>
<p>organizations it becomes the domain of</p>
<p>uh the public relations guys or the</p>
<p>market the marketing guys they need to</p>
<p>sit and check it every day and if you're</p>
<p>lucky they will respond larg</p>
<p>organizations like quas may have a</p>
<p>dedicated team that just sit and watch</p>
<p>watch Twitter um but you're still not</p>
<p>sure that everyone gets addressed um and</p>
<p>if I use the example of um of the um</p>
<p>worldwide uh grounding of the fleet that</p>
<p>Quantas had there were a lot of people</p>
<p>that just could not get through to help</p>
<p>discs they were stuck in certain places</p>
<p>and and it was unbelievable in how many</p>
<p>people actually went to Twitter to try</p>
<p>and you and and and that was that became</p>
<p>a instant Communication channel um where</p>
<p>they could where they could talk where</p>
<p>the actual conventional help disk</p>
<p>couldn't um cope with it but in a lot of</p>
<p>organizations this and and your</p>
<p>organization might be the same where um</p>
<p>the public relations guys say if if I</p>
<p>look at certain brands if I think about</p>
<p>people complaining about something on on</p>
<p>uh in our on one of our products or</p>
<p>unhappy or where they have a lot of</p>
<p>Praise because you actually want to grab</p>
<p>those testimonials as well um that at</p>
<p>the moment is the domain of the public</p>
<p>relations and the marketing guys um to</p>
<p>look at and make sure that they respond</p>
<p>and you need to make sure that they've</p>
<p>got the right tools now radian six is a</p>
<p>company owned by by by Salesforce and</p>
<p>they put out a 100 ways to use social</p>
<p>media monitoring um and I'm just going</p>
<p>to cover just some of them I'm not going</p>
<p>to go through all 100 ways just want to</p>
<p>explain or show you some of the examples</p>
<p>um that that they use and it's and it's</p>
<p>all around brand monitoring competitive</p>
<p>intelligence um looking at what is</p>
<p>around in the</p>
<p>industry some uh some thought leadership</p>
<p>things lead generation customer</p>
<p>service um looking at things that are</p>
<p>that you can use for search engine</p>
<p>optimization um crisis communication</p>
<p>product development so if I just look at</p>
<p>one of one or two of actual fact I think</p>
<p>there's three categories that we're</p>
<p>looking at just on these</p>
<p>um one of the most the the and the</p>
<p>reason probably why it's number one is</p>
<p>looking at online mentions of your brand</p>
<p>um the if you look at number five</p>
<p>something like discovering brand</p>
<p>Advocates trying to find those people</p>
<p>that that that that talk about your your</p>
<p>brand um the most popular topics around</p>
<p>your brand this is great information</p>
<p>that you can use for blog posts and</p>
<p>things like that um listening for</p>
<p>mentions of the executive team very very</p>
<p>important when there's certain people of</p>
<p>the executive team</p>
<p>um that are that are being talked about</p>
<p>you need to make sure that from a public</p>
<p>relations point of view that that is</p>
<p>also under control so this is all around</p>
<p>brand monitoring um as well and and you</p>
<p>can download the radian 6 um document</p>
<p>from from slideshare.net to search for</p>
<p>it um and you can actually go through</p>
<p>some of these the challenge that you</p>
<p>have with this is that there are no</p>
<p>actionable processes so you can see the</p>
<p>active verb here is listen listen learn</p>
<p>monitor to listen there's actually no</p>
<p>action being taken if we look at</p>
<p>competitive intelligence we want to know</p>
<p>something around what are what are</p>
<p>competitors launching what are the</p>
<p>what's the latest news around</p>
<p>competitors now this might not be</p>
<p>something that PR want to use this is</p>
<p>more for executive team so you want to</p>
<p>pass that on to the executive guys who</p>
<p>might be who who might be interested in</p>
<p>that you might might want to monitor</p>
<p>some specific employees in your</p>
<p>competitors their social profiles I'm</p>
<p>pretty sure there's some of my</p>
<p>competitors that are that would like to</p>
<p>do know some of the things I say on</p>
<p>social channels like LinkedIn uh and and</p>
<p>Twitter and I know that that some of</p>
<p>them actually follow um uh me on on on</p>
<p>on some of those</p>
<p>channels um you also want to know when</p>
<p>people are not happy with your</p>
<p>competitors and that needs to be passed</p>
<p>on to someone else in your</p>
<p>organization so that if we uh and once</p>
<p>again it's all around discover monitor</p>
<p>monitor there's actually no actionable</p>
<p>processes uh described here if we look</p>
<p>at custom customer service probably one</p>
<p>of the most used areas for for this it's</p>
<p>it's really around answering customer uh</p>
<p>questions you can there's a a lot of</p>
<p>companies that now use Facebook and the</p>
<p>discussions side of Facebook to actually</p>
<p>just answer questions you can resp you</p>
<p>can uh you can share company</p>
<p>information and um you can you can</p>
<p>actually respond to customer service</p>
<p>issues in real time that's the example</p>
<p>of quanas how good or bad they were</p>
<p>that's a separate discussion but the</p>
<p>fact that they could actually um and the</p>
<p>other key thing is at identify customer</p>
<p>service issues as they emerge I'm pretty</p>
<p>sure on that Saturday morning Quantas</p>
<p>had to put another thousand people onto</p>
<p>the onto their support desk to make sure</p>
<p>um that now how do you scale up and how</p>
<p>do you get that done quickly once again</p>
<p>no actionable processes coming out of</p>
<p>this the last one is um competitive</p>
<p>intelligence which um it's just a</p>
<p>different type of thing if you look at</p>
<p>your new product development side of</p>
<p>your business what do they want to know</p>
<p>they they want to know around</p>
<p>competitors launching new products they</p>
<p>want to know what people are thinking if</p>
<p>they're doing beta testing or they've</p>
<p>got uh some campaigns going out there</p>
<p>and just get customer feedback on that</p>
<p>um they want to listen to what people</p>
<p>are saying what is wrong with your</p>
<p>product so that they can add new</p>
<p>features now that that is something that</p>
<p>the pr guys would have no interest in so</p>
<p>picking up that sort of conversation it</p>
<p>may not get to the right new product</p>
<p>development guys in your business um so</p>
<p>once again no action able processes</p>
<p>coming out of</p>
<p>this what XM Pro is all about we we have</p>
<p>the ability to listen and action these</p>
<p>multiple channels so we call it we get</p>
<p>better at Social listening which is part</p>
<p>of our get better at getting work done</p>
<p>approach where if you look at how XM Pro</p>
<p>works one of the components the one at</p>
<p>the bottom is social based so a process</p>
<p>can either be can be started as a form</p>
<p>as a file time based and if you want</p>
<p>information on any of these um I'll take</p>
<p>you to our exm Pro Community uh at the</p>
<p>end of the presentation and just show</p>
<p>you where you can find some of this</p>
<p>information and some previous webinars</p>
<p>as well on some of that but if we look</p>
<p>at um the social listening we have a</p>
<p>social listener so one of the ways a</p>
<p>process can start is actually listening</p>
<p>for social events what then happens we</p>
<p>can put that onto someone's to-do list</p>
<p>on their action list on the the on their</p>
<p>work list on something that they need to</p>
<p>do and they can see that in Outlook</p>
<p>SharePoint in the browser on their</p>
<p>mobile phone so sometimes if you look at</p>
<p>the customer service ones you actually</p>
<p>may want to put it on someone's phone or</p>
<p>tablet device or whatever the case might</p>
<p>be once it's there there's a couple of</p>
<p>things that that we can do with it and</p>
<p>this is all standard XM functionality so</p>
<p>really all that we're introducing is</p>
<p>we've got the ability to listen and now</p>
<p>it goes into conventional Process</p>
<p>Management um when I say conventional we</p>
<p>have something unconventional which is</p>
<p>the whole dynamic routing so we can now</p>
<p>dynamically route and we'll show you</p>
<p>example of this as we as we show you the</p>
<p>social listening um what we can do is</p>
<p>also introduce the concept of social</p>
<p>discussions which is one of the other</p>
<p>legs of social BPM so we've got social</p>
<p>BPM in the actual um social listening</p>
<p>and then we can extend the social</p>
<p>capability by introducing discussions</p>
<p>into a process which is a quite a unique</p>
<p>concept um at this point in time we can</p>
<p>also integrate it to other applications</p>
<p>so for example when we find your hashtag</p>
<p>as your your at PVS and we know who you</p>
<p>are CU we got it in our CRM we can</p>
<p>actually populate all the rest of your</p>
<p>information um out of CRM in this</p>
<p>example Microsoft CRM or whatever</p>
<p>Salesforce or whatever you're using we</p>
<p>can bring that information and say this</p>
<p>is the rest of the information around</p>
<p>Peter it is great when you're doing</p>
<p>something like lead scoring where you</p>
<p>want to say well um there's been some</p>
<p>mention and Peter is mentioning</p>
<p>something around a certain product so</p>
<p>yeah he's in terms of lead scoring in</p>
<p>terms of his where he is on his journey</p>
<p>uh looking to buy some one of our prodct</p>
<p>product um we can add to that we can</p>
<p>apply business rules to that and we can</p>
<p>also do the normal notification</p>
<p>escalation notification escalation is</p>
<p>really critical in this area because if</p>
<p>someone replies and they have a problem</p>
<p>it's a customer service based issue you</p>
<p>actually want to be on top of it right</p>
<p>now and make sure that someone action it</p>
<p>immediately or in in within a a specific</p>
<p>um agreed service level um time and if</p>
<p>not we actually want to escalate it and</p>
<p>and get moving on it we can integrate</p>
<p>this into backend systems as I've</p>
<p>mentioned the CRM world or whatever um</p>
<p>it is and also we can we we can put it</p>
<p>in the cloud if you're interested in the</p>
<p>broader picture we have this available</p>
<p>um on our on our website for download</p>
<p>but this is the overall exm Pro picture</p>
<p>in this instance we take you from a</p>
<p>social listening point of view through</p>
<p>any one of our interfaces into Dynamic</p>
<p>routing and social discussions and</p>
<p>that's the example that we that we are</p>
<p>going going to show you so once again we</p>
<p>um we we can monitor multiple channels</p>
<p>whether it's uh tw Twitter Facebook</p>
<p>YouTube um our social listening ability</p>
<p>can actually listen across multiple</p>
<p>channels and there are a lot more than</p>
<p>this um I'm just using these these few</p>
<p>examples so it's not just at them we</p>
<p>we're going to show you how to how we</p>
<p>turn tweets into tasks um uh and then</p>
<p>into action and</p>
<p>um what we're going to show you is the</p>
<p>exm pro social listener so it's going to</p>
<p>start off there we're going to listen</p>
<p>for the exm pro hashtag and uh on on</p>
<p>Twitter and we then going to take that</p>
<p>into a exm pro based process you'll also</p>
<p>notice a new interface which I'll just</p>
<p>touch on once again we have additional</p>
<p>webinars and information on version six</p>
<p>so with that I'm going to just hand it</p>
<p>over to Gavin to uh Drive um I'll still</p>
<p>be talking</p>
<p>great</p>
<p>so that is um EX impro version 6 for</p>
<p>those of you that haven't seen that</p>
<p>before uh it's currently in beta we um</p>
<p>so I'm just going</p>
<p>to currently this is my task list so I'm</p>
<p>logged in as Keith Miller and you can</p>
<p>see um that now just as a matter of</p>
<p>interest when we were at the Gardner it</p>
<p>Expo on the Gold Coast a couple of weeks</p>
<p>ago we listened for the</p>
<p>hashtag uh hashgard Sim and we also</p>
<p>listened for um hash XM Pro we did it</p>
<p>live there and as people were were were</p>
<p>tweeting we were picking up those now um</p>
<p>just so as you can see my to-do list I'm</p>
<p>working in in one of the areas or what</p>
<p>it so the when we set up the listener we</p>
<p>can Define the rules so we can a</p>
<p>specific um keyword like hash X and pro</p>
<p>we can put on my to-do list if we find</p>
<p>um Hash Hash workflow suck um we can put</p>
<p>that on Gavin's to-do list so we can</p>
<p>have multiple so when we when we have</p>
<p>multiple words that or or or when we set</p>
<p>up the keywords that we listen for they</p>
<p>can actually be routed to completely</p>
<p>different people and that's the</p>
<p>opportunity that you have so the new</p>
<p>product development guys can listen for</p>
<p>something completely different than</p>
<p>start actionable processes to something</p>
<p>completely different to what the</p>
<p>marketing guys would be interested or</p>
<p>what the senior executive team might be</p>
<p>interested in so it'll put the relevant</p>
<p>task on your list in this instance um</p>
<p>just as a matter of Interest the one</p>
<p>that I tweeted as we started um it came</p>
<p>from me I said hash XM Pro great webinar</p>
<p>on social media so that was the the the</p>
<p>task that I started there's a couple of</p>
<p>things that I can do right right now</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so for example because they can see it's</p>
<p>had Hash Hash pedvs one of the things</p>
<p>that you can do is actually go into now</p>
<p>we we haven't set that up um but what</p>
<p>you can do is just bring the information</p>
<p>from Microsoft CRM um to actually</p>
<p>populate the rest of my information so</p>
<p>whoever it goes on to know exactly who I</p>
<p>am what my mobile number is what my</p>
<p>email address is if all of that</p>
<p>information sits in</p>
<p>and there's some great tools out there</p>
<p>that will that will actually take um</p>
<p>this information and actually put it</p>
<p>into CRM for you and then you can expose</p>
<p>that information or use that information</p>
<p>in here so there's multiple things that</p>
<p>you can do in this instance we're just</p>
<p>going to type a comment because we're</p>
<p>actually going to send it um through to</p>
<p>the pr guys to do something um because</p>
<p>um because um because I was on the</p>
<p>webinar and I said it was a great</p>
<p>webinar so you can do that from a c so</p>
<p>if someone comments on your customer</p>
<p>customer service day or your customer or</p>
<p>anything like that in this instance I</p>
<p>said it was a great webinar what it now</p>
<p>did what we now did is we said get a get</p>
<p>a white paper off to this guy so Tim</p>
<p>Clark who's the next person in the</p>
<p>process has now got an</p>
<p>action so we're just going to log out</p>
<p>here and as you'll see we've got</p>
<p>multiple service providers in actual</p>
<p>fact we now have social service</p>
<p>providers we can log you in with</p>
<p>LinkedIn we can log you in with your</p>
<p>Facebook account or whatever the case</p>
<p>might be um so in terms of social</p>
<p>extension or social BPM as I said</p>
<p>earlier it actually extends um quite a</p>
<p>bit further than just um being able to</p>
<p>listen with um with uh Twitter but in</p>
<p>this instance so you'll see under my</p>
<p>to-do list there's a um under public</p>
<p>relations I'm Tim Clark so I'm now the</p>
<p>second person this has now come through</p>
<p>to me so it came through from Keith you</p>
<p>can see it came through from Keith and</p>
<p>we're just going to click on that one so</p>
<p>that's my my to-do list and when we look</p>
<p>at the history in terms of how it got to</p>
<p>me I can now see</p>
<p>um the information that was completed at</p>
<p>that um point in time and I need to</p>
<p>follow up with with a um a webinar to uh</p>
<p>that person what I may want to do at</p>
<p>this point in time uh is actually is</p>
<p>actually just enter into a into a</p>
<p>discussion so this is something new that</p>
<p>we've also added into into version six</p>
<p>but it's a it's a key part just so um so</p>
<p>just just go back one step go</p>
<p>so if you look at um we currently in</p>
<p>that um there's some there's uh PVS um</p>
<p>great webinar um and Gavin may just want</p>
<p>to put sorry Tim in this instance might</p>
<p>just want to F before he sends out the</p>
<p>webinar I think may want to have a</p>
<p>discussion around this you know which</p>
<p>one is it the right one is it the um do</p>
<p>I have the latest version of the white</p>
<p>paper so that's sort of something that</p>
<p>he may want to ask now this is an</p>
<p>unstructured component there it's just a</p>
<p>conversation so we introducing the</p>
<p>concept of the other dimension of social</p>
<p>BPM where we can actually introduce uh</p>
<p>collaboration into the actual</p>
<p>transaction the nice thing with this is</p>
<p>we can uh we store this as part of the</p>
<p>exm pro audit trial and we can actually</p>
<p>put reporting onto this to to to go and</p>
<p>have a look at these discussions and</p>
<p>then say what why why does Tim always</p>
<p>have to ask the</p>
<p>question um around do I have the latest</p>
<p>version of the white paper so we may</p>
<p>want to improve our process around white</p>
<p>papers so what he's done in this</p>
<p>instance he's now put in a a a</p>
<p>discussion and if I click on the</p>
<p>history you'll see that there's now a</p>
<p>discussion as part of the the order</p>
<p>trial and if if we open that up there</p>
<p>can be</p>
<p>um um the discussion can be directed at</p>
<p>a group or it can be directed at an</p>
<p>individual so all the the replies and</p>
<p>everything to that um now stored against</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>so that is essentially how we can listen</p>
<p>to a</p>
<p>incoming uh signal like a tweet or a</p>
<p>LinkedIn mention or a Facebook or</p>
<p>whatever the case might be and turn in</p>
<p>this instance how how we turn a a tweet</p>
<p>into a task and give the ability now</p>
<p>what you'll see on the right hand side</p>
<p>is also U multiple options multiple</p>
<p>buttons so in terms of dynamic routing</p>
<p>you might actually want you know the</p>
<p>there might be because of what this</p>
<p>specific tweet was all around there</p>
<p>might be uh there might not be a very</p>
<p>defined workflow in terms of how it's</p>
<p>going to carry on from here based on</p>
<p>what I read I may want to say I want to</p>
<p>just send feedback I want to assign I</p>
<p>want to assign the case to someone else</p>
<p>or we just I need to give this to the</p>
<p>customer service guys to carry on with</p>
<p>this so you can have Dynamic what we</p>
<p>call Dynamic routing uh so it doesn't</p>
<p>have to be a structure process which is</p>
<p>also one of the um elements of um of BPM</p>
<p>um in the</p>
<p>future so I'm going to ask Gavin to just</p>
<p>hand me back</p>
<p>the the</p>
<p>screen great so what we what we</p>
<p>demonstrated to you is that we have a</p>
<p>social</p>
<p>listener if I just go and so what we</p>
<p>demonstrated is that we have a social</p>
<p>listener we can put it on your task list</p>
<p>and then we can invoke any standard</p>
<p>process that you may have in your</p>
<p>organization and we can do it for multip</p>
<p>multiples of channels so we can take for</p>
<p>example in this example as we showed you</p>
<p>we can take a tweet we can listen for a</p>
<p>specific word and that there actually</p>
<p>the one that I that I typed in um as you</p>
<p>were watching my my my Twitter</p>
<p>account and we can turn it into a exm</p>
<p>prob based process that process um each</p>
<p>individual channel can go to a</p>
<p>individual uh in organization or a to a</p>
<p>group in the in organization it applies</p>
<p>all the conventional um good BPM</p>
<p>practices from there just like to um</p>
<p>also invite you to go and have a look at</p>
<p>the what the exm pro community so if I</p>
<p>just go to the I'm just going to go to</p>
