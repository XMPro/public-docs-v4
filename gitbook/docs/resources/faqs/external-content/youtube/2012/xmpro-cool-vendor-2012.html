<p>XMPro is honored to be named a Gartner Cool Vendor for Business Process Management in 2012.</p>
<p>Gartner's approach to Intelligent Business Operations is the next evolution of process management, which involves handling unstructured processes, social collaboration that is built into processes, and the ability to deploy processes on mobile platforms.</p>
<p>XMPro's Event-based process approach rather than Workflow-based approach is what we believe to be one of the key reasons Gartner recognized our innovation. XMPro's approach to Intelligent Business Operations revolves around Case Management, Workflows and Business Rules implanted into the same audit trail (to avoid operating in two distinct products), Social Collaboration that is built into processes (to embed social conversations as part of process audit trails), Application Integration into backend business applications, Document Management in case files, and finally Process Analytics where Big Data, predictive models and Next Best Actions are entrenched into High risk, hard to control processes.</p>
<p>XMPro has bundled of this all together into &quot;Intelligent Business Operations Server&quot; or &quot;iBOS&quot;, and are really excited about the fact that Gartner recognized this BPMS solution.</p>

<summary>Transcript</summary>XMPro is extremely honored to be named a Gartner Cool Vendor for Business Process Management in 2012. 
<p>We're really excited about Gartner’s approach to Intelligent Business Operations, or what they call Intelligent Business Operations the next evolution of processes.</p>
<p>And for them it’s all around the ability to handle unstructured processes, to have social collaboration built into them, and also to deploy on mobile platforms for everyone to use.</p>
<p>Now XMPro’s Event-based approach rather than Workflow-based approach, we believe is one of the key reasons that Gartner recognized our innovation.</p>
<p>For us Intelligent Business Operations revolves around the fact that you can handle Cases.</p>
<p>You can handle Workflows and Business Rules all as one in the same audit trail, so they're not two distinct products.</p>
<p>You have Social Collaboration built into the processes so those social conversations are part of the audit trails for your business.</p>
<p>We are able to integration your backend business applications into the solution as well.</p>
<p>We bring documents into processes in our case files,</p>
<p>and probably what is most exciting is our ability to handle Process Analytics where we can embed your Big Data, we are able to build predictive models, and we are able to advise Next Best Actions.</p>
<p>We’ve bundled of this all together into what we call our Intelligent Business Operations Server or iBOS,</p>
<p>and we are really excited about the fact that Gartner recognized this BPMS solution.</p>
