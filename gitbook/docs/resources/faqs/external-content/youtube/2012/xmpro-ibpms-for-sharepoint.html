<details>
<summary>Transcript</summary>let's get started good morning everybody
<p>welcome to another XM Pro webinar</p>
<p>today we are going to go through XM Pro</p>
<p>and bringing ibpms to SharePoint</p>
<p>um example brings ibos which is an</p>
<p>intelligent business operations Suite</p>
<p>which we see as a convergence of</p>
<p>business Process Management and bi if</p>
<p>you require any more information on us</p>
<p>contact us after this webinar our sales</p>
<p>team or our partners will be more than</p>
<p>happy to provide you with more details</p>
<p>on that</p>
<p>so what do we do we bring the Next</p>
<p>Generation business Process Management</p>
<p>which Gardner calls ibpms to SharePoint</p>
<p>which I'm going to take you through</p>
<p>today</p>
<p>so what are we going to cover today</p>
<p>we've got three objectives we're going</p>
<p>to go into the first one is intelligent</p>
<p>processes within SharePoint</p>
<p>what do we mean by intelligent processes</p>
<p>follow this up with some examples as</p>
<p>well</p>
<p>um how to upload a document to a</p>
<p>SharePoint document library and the last</p>
<p>one is using a SharePoint list as a data</p>
<p>source</p>
<p>so intelligent processes and SharePoint</p>
<p>the benefits of what we bring to the</p>
<p>table of bringing intelligent processes</p>
<p>into SharePoint</p>
<p>we've highlighted the three big ones</p>
<p>that we've found the first one is there</p>
<p>is no coding</p>
<p>you do not need to open Visual Studio or</p>
<p>any coding</p>
<p>platform to deploy these processes into</p>
<p>SharePoint</p>
<p>a SharePoint consultant or a business</p>
<p>analyst can configure these</p>
<p>they can configure the processes they</p>
<p>can configure the web Parts they can</p>
<p>configure the data lists that make up</p>
<p>the lookups that you're actually going</p>
<p>to be using within your processes</p>
<p>themselves</p>
<p>and the last one is the same process</p>
<p>information is available within</p>
<p>SharePoint within Outlook within the web</p>
<p>depending on your platform of choice for</p>
<p>your end users so you're not confined to</p>
<p>just your SharePoint environment you've</p>
<p>got the exact same process information</p>
<p>so you define it once</p>
<p>it's available on multiple interfaces</p>
<p>for your users to to work through</p>
<p>we're going to work through an example</p>
<p>of X and prone SharePoint and we're</p>
<p>going to touch on a few items</p>
<p>the first one is the standard web part</p>
<p>the task list</p>
<p>the process form how we render it in</p>
<p>SharePoint what it looks like what</p>
<p>components are available in it and</p>
<p>lastly how to configure</p>
<p>these web Parts within SharePoint</p>
<p>I'm going to leave the PowerPoint there</p>
<p>I'm just going to</p>
<p>bring across the web interface</p>
<p>this is not SharePoint for those of you</p>
<p>that are familiar with SharePoint this</p>
<p>is our web interface what I'm actually</p>
<p>going to do for my web interface</p>
<p>is creating your acquisition</p>
<p>and with this requisition we're actually</p>
<p>going to process it</p>
<p>push it through to the next step and</p>
<p>then we're going to access that perform</p>
<p>within SharePoint itself</p>
<p>so the first step we're going to do in</p>
<p>XM Pros web front-end the Second Step</p>
<p>from that point onwards is going to be</p>
<p>from within SharePoint itself</p>
<p>so we're just going to keep it very</p>
<p>basic</p>
<p>stock requisition within the it category</p>
<p>we just need to procure a new server</p>
<p>rack for</p>
<p>Cloud background infrastructure</p>
<p>let's attach a sample quote</p>
<p>the stock code</p>
<p>a description</p>
<p>the price we're requiring one</p>
<p>and we are going to submit that document</p>
<p>so what we're actually done here</p>
<p>is</p>
<p>if I switch to the</p>
<p>SharePoint interface</p>
<p>is triggered it from the X and pro</p>
<p>screen</p>
<p>and push that information through into</p>
<p>SharePoint itself</p>
<p>what you're looking at here for those</p>
<p>who use familiar with SharePoint is the</p>
<p>SharePoint 2010 installation</p>
<p>this will be your portal login</p>
<p>from your corporate environment</p>
<p>we've kept it very basic to what you're</p>
<p>looking at here what we've done is if I</p>
<p>open an XM Pro for shape one down the</p>
<p>bottom</p>
<p>it will load a basic web part page</p>
<p>and on that webpod page</p>
<p>it's waiting for your screens to catch</p>
<p>up there</p>
<p>and on the webpite page</p>
<p>you will see two web parts</p>
<p>you've got web parts</p>
<p>on the left and you have a web port on</p>
<p>the right</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>we've got a task list</p>
<p>that we've populated on the left</p>
<p>if I stop here for a minute</p>
<p>and we go back into the XM web interface</p>
<p>if I open up his to do task list and</p>
<p>open up the broadcasting</p>
<p>you'll see we have capture match Tuesday</p>
<p>brief capture promotional brief and</p>
<p>capture a Wacky Wednesday brief as well</p>
<p>if we move over to the SharePoint web</p>
<p>part I'll draw your attention to the top</p>
<p>we have capture a promotion brief and</p>
<p>mad Tuesday brief and a Wacky Wednesday</p>
<p>brief</p>
<p>so what we've actually got there</p>
<p>let's go back there</p>
<p>what we've actually got there is a</p>
<p>single data set of information you're</p>
<p>looking at the exact same process task</p>
<p>list which is available in our web</p>
<p>interface and is available in our</p>
<p>SharePoint interface</p>
<p>if I open up</p>
<p>any one of the tasks themselves you'll</p>
<p>see the exact same task available in</p>
<p>both interfaces as well</p>
<p>so all we've got is it looks like a very</p>
<p>busy screen and I'll walk you through</p>
<p>what we're actually looking at on the</p>
<p>screen here</p>
<p>so to keep it simple we've got two web</p>
<p>Parts on the screen you've got a web pod</p>
<p>Zone on the left and we've got a web pod</p>
<p>Zone on the right</p>
<p>if I move my mouse over the top you'll</p>
<p>see you've got your basic SharePoint</p>
<p>webpod functionality</p>
<p>this is</p>
<p>sharepoint's own functionality with</p>
<p>regards to web pod I can edit these web</p>
<p>parts and move them around if I edit</p>
<p>this Web Bot</p>
<p>you'll see I'm looking at a webpart page</p>
<p>with the various zones and I can drag</p>
<p>the web pods in as I'm looking at them</p>
<p>what you're looking at is one</p>
<p>configuration option we have for web</p>
<p>Parts there are multiple configuration</p>
<p>options depending on your needs and</p>
<p>requirements within an organization</p>
<p>um some organizations are quite happy</p>
<p>with how they're looking at it here you</p>
<p>can configure the amount of columns</p>
<p>you're looking at so if I scroll to the</p>
<p>right</p>
<p>what you're looking at there is the top</p>
<p>off of that is sharepoints configuration</p>
<p>options for a basic web pod what we've</p>
<p>actually done is at the bottom we've</p>
<p>introduced X and pro specific items to</p>
<p>that webpod as well so we've extended</p>
<p>the web part itself</p>
<p>if I go into the columns</p>
<p>you'll see at the moment I've got due</p>
<p>number and from ticked so I can</p>
<p>configure all of them on I can configure</p>
<p>all of them off depending on my needs</p>
<p>and my requirements</p>
<p>if I expand the list properties I can</p>
<p>allow sorting I can allow paging I can</p>
<p>allow grouping</p>
<p>so whatever your needs and requirements</p>
<p>are for lists within SharePoint process</p>
<p>list task list you can configure the web</p>
<p>Parts you can have multiple web Parts as</p>
<p>well you don't have to just have the two</p>
<p>web Parts we've got on the screen you</p>
<p>can have multiple on the screen each</p>
<p>serving a different purpose</p>
<p>if I cancel it</p>
<p>let's wait for the SharePoint</p>
<p>environment to cancel the um</p>
<p>web pod editing and we come back to the</p>
<p>form that we're looking at</p>
<p>so what we're looking at here is we've</p>
<p>got a list of tasks for a specific user</p>
<p>down the left as soon as he clicks on a</p>
<p>specific task it's going to open up the</p>
<p>task definition we've configured on the</p>
<p>right</p>
<p>in this instance it's a purchase</p>
<p>requisition</p>
<p>we've got an approval name his approval</p>
<p>limit requisition total and we have a</p>
<p>budget goal in the middle indicating his</p>
<p>current budget his actual he's committed</p>
<p>to and is requested which brings through</p>
<p>the the details down the bottom</p>
<p>from the person requesting</p>
<p>and the current user can put comments in</p>
<p>we can view the current process flow</p>
<p>diagram at the top as well</p>
<p>so what we're looking at here is a</p>
<p>budget graph within an approval form</p>
<p>what we've got along the right there are</p>
<p>the various routing</p>
<p>of the various routing options</p>
<p>as is categories for it</p>
<p>you'll see we have a tech approval along</p>
<p>the right</p>
<p>if I picked a category from the previous</p>
<p>step as maintenance I would get a</p>
<p>maintenance approval or if I picked it</p>
<p>for finance I'll get a finance approval</p>
<p>so you have Dynamic routing options</p>
<p>which appear on the right which are</p>
<p>context aware</p>
<p>they're aware of the information that's</p>
<p>captured on the screen</p>
<p>and they adapt themselves accordingly</p>
<p>what we're going to do here</p>
<p>is</p>
<p>this is our design environment</p>
<p>what we call the does XM designer this</p>
<p>is where we configure the processes once</p>
<p>to deploy them to the multiple platforms</p>
<p>if I double click the first approval</p>
<p>this is the same approval screen that</p>
<p>we've just looked at with the graph in</p>
<p>the middle</p>
<p>the budget graph asking for approval for</p>
<p>specific spend to specific category</p>
<p>if I drag the chart in</p>
<p>and we just go set up some properties</p>
<p>let's get rid of his caption</p>
<p>let's open up the chart</p>
<p>so what we've opened up here is what we</p>
<p>call our chart wizard which allows us to</p>
<p>build our in-flight analytics into</p>
<p>processes</p>
<p>I'm going to leave it as a bar chart</p>
<p>you've got appearance options you can</p>
<p>change its colors</p>
<p>you can change its styling options so</p>
<p>everything doesn't have to be the the X</p>
<p>and pro colors or orange all across the</p>
<p>board</p>
<p>it can handle multiple series as well</p>
<p>I'm going to call this month</p>
<p>and there's various other options down</p>
<p>the bottom here you've got full control</p>
<p>over how your charts get configured with</p>
<p>regards to where are their point labels</p>
<p>where they're chart titles if we're</p>
<p>going to diagram</p>
<p>because I've picked a bar chart I'd</p>
<p>actually like this chart to be rotated</p>
<p>it's going to make a lot more sense to</p>
<p>me rotated versus horizontal I've got</p>
<p>control over axis I want to give the</p>
<p>charter title as well</p>
<p>so let's call this spin to date</p>
<p>and I can click finish</p>
<p>if I go back to</p>
<p>our SharePoint form</p>
<p>and we refresh that form itself</p>
<p>what you'll see right at the bottom as</p>
<p>it was the last control I've added onto</p>
<p>the form will have a second chart that's</p>
<p>going to appear</p>
<p>pulling information now this chart can</p>
<p>pull its information from multitudes of</p>
<p>sources that can pull it from a sap</p>
<p>system</p>
<p>it can pull it from an oracle system it</p>
<p>can put it from a flat file system it</p>
<p>can pull it from a modern mainframe</p>
<p>system you can put it from a legacy</p>
<p>mainframe system</p>
<p>so if I scroll down</p>
<p>you'll see I have my current spend to</p>
<p>date</p>
<p>now</p>
<p>it's good having the two graphs I'd like</p>
<p>to move this chart up so that it</p>
<p>actually makes a lot more sense above my</p>
<p>budget goal</p>
<p>if I go back into the workspace itself</p>
<p>I'm just going to change the index</p>
<p>for the chart</p>
<p>once again if we refresh that form</p>
<p>you'll see we have spin to date which</p>
<p>now appearing above budget call so very</p>
<p>quickly</p>
<p>you can start creating in-flight</p>
<p>analytics and have it push through into</p>
<p>a SharePoint front-end we drag the chart</p>
<p>on</p>
<p>linked it to an existing data set</p>
<p>configured the various options on it and</p>
<p>surface it for the actual approval user</p>
<p>to have a look at</p>
<p>if I bring us back to the PowerPoint</p>
<p>so what we've just gone through is an</p>
<p>example of X and pro and SharePoint so</p>
<p>we've looked at a standard Web Bot we</p>
<p>saw an example with two web pods one on</p>
<p>the left one on the right the one on the</p>
<p>left being a task list</p>
<p>the one on the right being the actual</p>
<p>form render web pod</p>
<p>so task list is exactly the same task</p>
<p>list as any other X and pro interface</p>
<p>it's the exact same task as you look at</p>
<p>if you log into the web if you log into</p>
<p>Outlook</p>
<p>the process form we had a look at how</p>
<p>the form is rendered</p>
<p>we had a look at the information that</p>
<p>was being pulled through from that form</p>
<p>we added an extra chart onto the four</p>
<p>linked it to an existing data set which</p>
<p>brought a lot more</p>
<p>information to the user context</p>
<p>information to the user</p>
<p>and then lastly we looked at how to</p>
<p>configure</p>
<p>so how to configure a webpart firstly</p>
<p>exactly the same as you will configure</p>
<p>any other web part in SharePoint it's</p>
<p>got the same SharePoint webpod options</p>
<p>we've just extended them and added a few</p>
<p>extra at the bottom to control how the</p>
<p>lists display their information and how</p>
<p>the form displays this information we</p>
<p>also looked at how to configure our</p>
<p>in-flight Analytics</p>
<p>by creating a basic chart</p>
<p>linking it to an existing data set</p>
<p>and move the chart around on the actual</p>
<p>form</p>
<p>what we're going to look at next is</p>
<p>intelligence which is not found in</p>
<p>SharePoint</p>
<p>the first one we're going to cover is</p>
<p>what we call Process goals</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>foreign</p>
<p>discussions</p>
<p>the third one is next best actions</p>
<p>and finally the last one case files</p>
<p>so we're going to take each of these and</p>
<p>have a look at how is this intelligence</p>
<p>which is not currently in SharePoint</p>
<p>brought to SharePoint with X and Pros</p>
<p>ibos</p>
<p>offering</p>
<p>if I stop the PowerPoint there and let's</p>
<p>come back to</p>
<p>the XM Pro screen</p>
<p>once again it's exactly the same screen</p>
<p>we've just looked at</p>
<p>we've got the chart I'm going to leave</p>
<p>the chart on there for the rest of this</p>
<p>webinar</p>
<p>we've got the list on the left</p>
<p>standard webparts for both of them</p>
<p>what we're going to look at with regards</p>
<p>to the intelligence we bring to the</p>
<p>table is across the top</p>
<p>so the first one we've got is process</p>
<p>goals</p>
<p>a process goals allows you to visualize</p>
<p>and each work step to help guide your</p>
<p>business decisions</p>
<p>you configure these per process</p>
<p>and what it's doing is providing more</p>
<p>information</p>
<p>contextual information to the person who</p>
<p>needs to make the approval decisions</p>
<p>so in this example</p>
<p>we're working with the purchase</p>
<p>requisition so we have the current</p>
<p>budget versus actual we have our current</p>
<p>budget and the spend for last year</p>
<p>across the top</p>
<p>if I scroll right we have our actual</p>
<p>spend per department and we can have a</p>
<p>look at it is</p>
<p>quite a bit more than the finance and HR</p>
<p>combined</p>
<p>that gives me more information</p>
<p>to help make my decision</p>
<p>if I close the process goals</p>
<p>if I open up the history</p>
<p>what the history is showing is the</p>
<p>entire order Trail for the process</p>
<p>so every single step that we do is</p>
<p>auditable</p>
<p>every step that we capture</p>
<p>goes into a time and date stamp attached</p>
<p>to a user itself</p>
<p>if I scroll down</p>
<p>what you'll see there is we've got two</p>
<p>icons</p>
<p>the first icon indicates to me that it</p>
<p>was a specific task</p>
<p>so task one was to create a new</p>
<p>acquisition</p>
<p>what the second icon tells me is the</p>
<p>discussion was actually created linked</p>
<p>to that task</p>
<p>this brings us back to</p>
<p>if I just jump to the</p>
<p>PowerPoint once again this brings us</p>
<p>back to social process discussions</p>
<p>social discussions around a process now</p>
<p>this can be</p>
<p>a specific transaction</p>
<p>or this can be globally at process level</p>
<p>I'm not happy with the procurement</p>
<p>process it's taking too long or I'm not</p>
<p>happy with the step in the procurement</p>
<p>process is asking for too much</p>
<p>information I don't have available at</p>
<p>the time</p>
<p>in the current example</p>
<p>we actually have a process</p>
<p>discussion which is attached to a</p>
<p>transaction</p>
<p>you can drill all the way down into that</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>it will bring the information back</p>
<p>specific to that transaction itself</p>
<p>so if I scroll a bit further down what</p>
<p>are the specifications we are looking</p>
<p>for for the server or looking at for the</p>
<p>server</p>
<p>so very quickly</p>
<p>you can start getting a social</p>
<p>collaboration around a specific</p>
<p>transaction if there is more information</p>
<p>that you need from a specific individual</p>
<p>it also allows you to start working out</p>
<p>the social influences in the process you</p>
<p>may have a process which spans across</p>
<p>your organization</p>
<p>it goes through five levels of approval</p>
<p>but actually it's going through eight</p>
<p>levels of approval two other levels or</p>
<p>three other levels are going through</p>
<p>email a phone call and instant message</p>
<p>or some other mechanism which is not</p>
<p>being captured</p>
<p>if we go to the discuss at the top</p>
<p>what we've got here this is where we</p>
<p>actually capture the discussions</p>
<p>and Link them to a specific task</p>
<p>or link them to a</p>
<p>Global holistic level of a process</p>
<p>so I can pick a procurement purchase</p>
<p>requisition and I can capture a message</p>
<p>I think this process is taking too long</p>
<p>they're too many steps in it</p>
<p>or if it's a customer onboarding process</p>
<p>I think we need to revamp take it from a</p>
<p>structured process to unstructured I</p>
<p>cannot get to the steps in time even</p>
<p>though I know more information about the</p>
<p>user itself</p>
<p>I can discuss it with a particular user</p>
<p>or I can leave it open to everyone</p>
<p>that's got access to that actual</p>
<p>process itself</p>
<p>and lastly</p>
<p>next best</p>
<p>what next best</p>
<p>does</p>
<p>is it has a look at predictive as well</p>
<p>as history</p>
<p>and works out what is the next step</p>
<p>you should take</p>
<p>it's not going to force you to take the</p>
<p>step it's just offering up the options</p>
<p>for you to take the step</p>
<p>so we've got process goals</p>
<p>which are giving you more information</p>
<p>with regards to your kpis</p>
<p>so how are you tracking budget versus</p>
<p>actual</p>
<p>how are you tracking per Department</p>
<p>next best action is saying</p>
<p>for this given</p>
<p>process</p>
<p>we've had 145 approvals we've had 38</p>
<p>technical approvals and we've had 17</p>
<p>declines it's not going to force you to</p>
<p>approve it it's not going to force you</p>
<p>to do a technical approval what it's</p>
<p>going to do is provide you more</p>
<p>information so that you can better make</p>
<p>a decision on where this task is</p>
<p>actually going to be going</p>
<p>so if we close that again</p>
<p>if I bring this back to to SharePoint</p>
<p>again and let's take it from the top</p>
<p>so intelligence not found in SharePoint</p>
<p>process goals kpis you define at a</p>
<p>process level</p>
<p>which provide context information to the</p>
<p>user</p>
<p>second social process discussions</p>
<p>discussions around a specific</p>
<p>transaction</p>
<p>or discussions around a specific process</p>
<p>process improvement process enhancement</p>
<p>next best action</p>
<p>what</p>
<p>is the predictive nature of this process</p>
<p>where is it going if I pick a specific</p>
<p>path</p>
<p>once again the system's not forcing you</p>
<p>to take that path it's offering up an</p>
<p>option for you to have a look at to</p>
<p>better make your decision</p>
<p>and lastly Case Files which I'll go back</p>
<p>to and illustrate now so what the four</p>
<p>of those</p>
<p>are trying to help is the person who</p>
<p>needs to make a decision to give him</p>
<p>more information</p>
<p>more contextual information</p>
<p>so that he can better make the decision</p>
<p>that he needs to</p>
<p>if we go back to this example</p>
<p>if this process didn't have a budget</p>
<p>goal graphene or did not have a spend to</p>
<p>date graph in here</p>
<p>the person who's doing approval would</p>
<p>have his limit his requisition total and</p>
<p>a comment typically what would happen is</p>
<p>you would work out do I have a budget</p>
<p>for this</p>
<p>have I exceeded my budget go and I Work</p>
<p>It Out open up Excel have a look at your</p>
<p>graphs in Excel what we've done is we've</p>
<p>taken all of that and made that part of</p>
<p>the actual process so we've got the</p>
<p>in-flight Analytics</p>
<p>once again you can hook that up to any</p>
<p>data source if it's a sap backend you</p>
<p>can hook it up to sap if you're looking</p>
<p>at an oracle if you're looking at a SQL</p>
<p>if you're looking at a flat file</p>
<p>whatever your data source is can be</p>
<p>sucked in and actually rendered as a</p>
<p>specific in-flight Analytics</p>
<p>within the process itself</p>
<p>we touched on process goals across the</p>
<p>top</p>
<p>once again your kpis Define at process</p>
<p>level</p>
<p>we had a look at the history</p>
<p>history using the</p>
<p>transaction</p>
<p>as well as the discussion both forming</p>
<p>part of the order Trail</p>
<p>so you can For the First Time Track</p>
<p>a transaction from end to end as well as</p>
<p>the social interactions that happened</p>
<p>within that process you can put your</p>
<p>analytics on top of that as well and</p>
<p>start working out who are the social</p>
<p>influences within your organization</p>
<p>why is a purchase requisition always</p>
<p>going to person X for approval or for a</p>
<p>comment or for a recommendation should</p>
<p>you not be made part of the process</p>
<p>then knowledge transfer which needs to</p>
<p>happen</p>
<p>your business process needs to evolve to</p>
<p>incorporate the social discussion</p>
<p>aspects of that and then the last one we</p>
<p>touched on was the next best action</p>
<p>itself</p>
<p>the predictive analytical nature where</p>
<p>should this go</p>
<p>based on the past history of this actual</p>
<p>process itself</p>
<p>and then the last one is Case Files</p>
<p>themselves</p>
<p>what case files does here is any</p>
<p>document which has been attached as part</p>
<p>of the process it puts it into a central</p>
<p>location as part of the process for you</p>
<p>to actually View</p>
<p>this was the process I submitted</p>
<p>previously we had the quote what the</p>
<p>icon on the right there tells us is to</p>
<p>what system was this uploaded it was</p>
<p>uploaded into SharePoint it can be</p>
<p>uploaded into whatever document</p>
<p>repository you have it does not have to</p>
<p>be SharePoint in this instance it is</p>
<p>SharePoint we can upload documents into</p>
<p>a flat file system and Link it into part</p>
<p>of the process as well</p>
<p>foreign</p>
<p>so intelligence not found in SharePoint</p>
<p>the second area we wanted to touch on</p>
<p>was how to upload a document into</p>
<p>SharePoint</p>
<p>first of all the benefits of doing that</p>
<p>from within a process environment is you</p>
<p>can apply your version management you</p>
<p>can apply your meter data to the</p>
<p>document</p>
<p>so if you have specific documentation</p>
<p>which needs to be uploaded if you've got</p>
<p>a policy documentation or a contract</p>
<p>which has specific meter data attached</p>
<p>to a contract you'd want to push that</p>
<p>through into SharePoint as well</p>
<p>SharePoint handles the</p>
<p>indexing of that which means the</p>
<p>searching and bringing up after that</p>
<p>information</p>
<p>is very quick</p>
<p>all process related documents get</p>
<p>properly stored in index</p>
<p>so once again you're using the power of</p>
<p>SharePoint to properly index and store</p>
<p>and allow you to pull that information</p>
<p>out from within SharePoint</p>
<p>if I flick back to the actual SharePoint</p>
<p>now when we started this process we</p>
<p>started it from the Action Pro</p>
<p>front end we captured our acquisition we</p>
<p>attached a quote</p>
<p>where that code got uploaded to</p>
<p>whereas if I go to the root of the</p>
<p>SharePoint site</p>
<p>if you have a look down the left we have</p>
<p>libraries</p>
<p>I created a file uploads Library kept it</p>
<p>very</p>
<p>open</p>
<p>and we have a quote which was attached</p>
<p>in here</p>
<p>um you can upload documentation into the</p>
<p>system simply</p>
<p>so you can have one folder where all</p>
<p>your documents get uploaded into</p>
<p>SharePoint or you can have multiple</p>
<p>folders within a specific location</p>
<p>so if you are looking at policies</p>
<p>and your policies are related to a</p>
<p>client you could have a client folder</p>
<p>upload your various policy documents</p>
<p>into those specific folders</p>
<p>and shipwin handles the document</p>
<p>retrieval and indexing of those</p>
<p>documents themselves</p>
<p>if I go back to the home page</p>
<p>so once again the benefits of uploading</p>
<p>a document into SharePoint version</p>
<p>management very important you can have</p>
<p>multiple versions of a document</p>
<p>it will also store the changes on those</p>
<p>documents as well so you can see who</p>
<p>checked something out who made a change</p>
<p>and revert the change back to a previous</p>
<p>version if there was something wrong</p>
<p>with the the new version of the document</p>
<p>metadata</p>
<p>very important for indexing retrieval</p>
<p>purposes and then once again all your</p>
<p>process related documents get properly</p>
<p>stored index for easy retrieval</p>
<p>and lastly to use a SharePoint list as a</p>
<p>data source</p>
<p>you would want to use a SharePoint list</p>
<p>as a lookup</p>
<p>or a drop down field</p>
<p>the reasons for doing this is a business</p>
<p>user</p>
<p>can manage and create these data sets</p>
<p>that are used as lookup</p>
<p>you can reuse the master data across</p>
<p>your organization so if you already have</p>
<p>lists that are configured within</p>
<p>SharePoint</p>
<p>you can use these within a process</p>
<p>it's easier to set up and manage these</p>
<p>lists from SharePoint</p>
<p>I will show us an example</p>
<p>if we go back into SharePoint itself</p>
<p>you'll see I have a lists Library down</p>
<p>the left if I click lookup</p>
<p>you'll see we have</p>
<p>the list is term lookup</p>
<p>and within it we have maintenance RT</p>
<p>cleaning finance and I've just linked it</p>
<p>to a procurement type of General</p>
<p>for those of you who saw the</p>
<p>previous</p>
<p>step that I did within the XM workspace</p>
<p>those should look familiar</p>
<p>if I open up</p>
<p>a purchase requisition you'll see we</p>
<p>have a category</p>
<p>that SharePoint list we're looking at is</p>
<p>driving the contents of that drop down</p>
<p>if I go in and we add a new item</p>
<p>let's call this spares</p>
<p>and I'm going to link it to General and</p>
<p>we're going to save so now I've got</p>
<p>maintenance RT</p>
<p>cleaning finance and Spares</p>
<p>if I go back to</p>
<p>the X and pro screen</p>
<p>we have spares down the bottom</p>
<p>if I do the same from within SharePoint</p>
<p>so once again I'm just going to the</p>
<p>portal page within SharePoint I've got</p>
<p>an open X and pro for SharePoint down</p>
<p>the bottom</p>
<p>the two web parts</p>
<p>right across the top I have a process</p>
<p>list</p>
<p>if I scroll down I can create a new</p>
<p>purchase requisition</p>
<p>if I have a look at the category we have</p>
<p>Maintenance Cleaning it spares and</p>
<p>finance come through there as well so</p>
<p>one definition for this process surfaced</p>
<p>in multiple interfaces</p>
<p>if I go back into SharePoint and I</p>
<p>actually delete</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>space</p>
<p>so I'm going to delete that list</p>
<p>I'm going to go back up to the main</p>
<p>portal</p>
<p>once again process list</p>
<p>scroll down to the actual requisition</p>
<p>itself</p>
<p>Maintenance Cleaning RT and finance</p>
<p>so very quickly I can configure and</p>
<p>manage my data lists within SharePoint</p>
<p>which is easy and simple for a business</p>
<p>user to do</p>
<p>if you already have</p>
<p>lists created</p>
<p>you can reuse those lists as well</p>
<p>it's easier to set up once again you can</p>
<p>also apply security to these lists from</p>
<p>within SharePoint itself</p>
<p>so if I'm querying</p>
<p>let's just go back to the top</p>
<p>and we go back to our list</p>
<p>I have a specific procurement type that</p>
<p>I was linking this to you can set up</p>
<p>various access and securities and</p>
<p>SharePoint so that specific individuals</p>
<p>do not have access to specific</p>
<p>procurement types or requisition types</p>
<p>I've got a very simple example here you</p>
<p>may have your cost centers stored and</p>
<p>maintained within SharePoint if user is</p>
<p>not allowed a specific cost center you</p>
<p>would set that security up in SharePoint</p>
<p>and we would enforce that security</p>
<p>within XM Pro as well so that</p>
<p>information is not</p>
<p>surface where access is not</p>
<p>given for it</p>
<p>so using SharePoint list as a data</p>
<p>source why it's a lot easier to manage</p>
<p>and create data sets from a business</p>
<p>user's perspective in SharePoint and</p>
<p>have that surfaced in an X and pro form</p>
<p>as a lookup or a drop down field</p>
<p>you're going to reuse your existing data</p>
<p>sets so there's no need to go into SQL</p>
<p>create a table</p>
<p>copy that information into it and then</p>
<p>have the whole management and</p>
<p>maintenance on that as well</p>
<p>there's the list within SharePoint are</p>
<p>version so you can have a look at who</p>
<p>deletes what versus who added what so</p>
<p>there is auditability on the list in</p>
<p>there which is built in as part of the</p>
<p>SharePoint list itself</p>
<p>so just to wrap up what we've gone</p>
<p>through</p>
<p>I'm going to start at the back and work</p>
<p>my way forward</p>
<p>so using a SharePoint list as a data</p>
<p>source</p>
<p>so we link that into an actual process</p>
<p>we used it as a drop down and we used it</p>
<p>as a category filter for a procurement</p>
<p>request</p>
<p>uploading a document into a SharePoint</p>
<p>document Library</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you can keep it simple and put it into a</p>
<p>global</p>
<p>SharePoint document library or you can</p>
<p>be very specific and upload it into</p>
<p>specific designated SharePoint libraries</p>
<p>hand in hand with this you've got your</p>
<p>SharePoint versioning of documents</p>
<p>you've got your metadata which goes with</p>
<p>it</p>
<p>and you've got the proper indexing and</p>
<p>retrieval</p>
<p>through the SharePoint search</p>
<p>capabilities for this document</p>
<p>the document is linked in the case File</p>
<p>function</p>
<p>so you can have a look at that from a</p>
<p>process perspective versus having to go</p>
<p>into the SharePoint document Library</p>
<p>find the document and pull that</p>
<p>information out there as well</p>
<p>and then where we started intelligent</p>
<p>processes within SharePoint</p>
<p>XM Pro brings</p>
<p>ibpms to SharePoint</p>
<p>within that we had a look at standard</p>
<p>web parts</p>
<p>we had a very simple</p>
<p>SharePoint webpod page we had tasks and</p>
<p>lists on the left and we had the form on</p>
<p>the right</p>
<p>the task list the same task list is</p>
<p>available in all the X and pro</p>
<p>interfaces so you deploy it once</p>
<p>see it in multiple interfaces</p>
<p>we had a look at it in the web interface</p>
<p>and then we switched over to the</p>
<p>SharePoint interface</p>
<p>the process form how does the form</p>
<p>render in SharePoint</p>
<p>how does this form render Within</p>
<p>a standard X and pro web front-end as</p>
<p>well and it's the exact same form</p>
<p>rendering in Outlook if that's your</p>
<p>chosen interface to your end users</p>
<p>then we had a look at how to configure</p>
<p>firstly web parts</p>
<p>the wherepots</p>
<p>exactly the same as you would configure</p>
<p>any SharePoint web pod</p>
<p>you can edit the web parts you've got</p>
<p>your SharePoint functionality we've</p>
<p>extended that with X and pro specific</p>
<p>information around lists columns where's</p>
<p>it getting its information colors that</p>
<p>kind of information on a webpod</p>
<p>then what we had to look as</p>
<p>a look at is</p>
<p>what intelligence</p>
<p>which is not found in SharePoint</p>
<p>the first one we looked at was a process</p>
<p>goal</p>
<p>a kpi defined at a process level</p>
<p>which provides more information to the</p>
<p>user who needs to make a decision the</p>
<p>second one we looked at was a social</p>
<p>process discussion</p>
<p>once again at transaction level</p>
<p>and secondly at a process level process</p>
<p>Improvement level the ability to start</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>from within the process itself</p>
<p>as well as the audit history surfacing</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>task process</p>
<p>discussion as well as responses to the</p>
<p>discussion as well so it's all part of</p>
<p>the ordered history so for the first</p>
<p>time we can</p>
<p>add and Link</p>
<p>social process discussions to a process</p>
<p>transaction and actually have an audit</p>
<p>trail that represents that</p>
<p>the third one was an Express action</p>
<p>Predictive Analytics</p>
<p>looking at the history of that actual</p>
<p>process where's the history of that</p>
<p>going and predicting where the next</p>
<p>logical step for the routing would be</p>
<p>once again it's not going to make the</p>
<p>decision for you it's just providing you</p>
<p>more context information so that you can</p>
<p>better make the decisions you need to</p>
<p>make with that process and the last one</p>
<p>is the Case Files themselves</p>
<p>we've uploaded a document to SharePoint</p>
<p>we've uploaded a second document and a</p>
<p>third step and a fourth step if you wish</p>
<p>to view these documents without the case</p>
<p>File feature you would need to go into</p>
<p>SharePoint</p>
<p>find the specific document library and</p>
<p>pull that information out so what we did</p>
<p>with the case File is we've given you</p>
<p>the the functionality from within the</p>
<p>process itself to click the case File</p>
<p>open up and that will return your list</p>
<p>of all documents which have been</p>
<p>uploaded irrespective of their document</p>
<p>repository whether it's SharePoint</p>
<p>whether it's a file system whether it's</p>
<p>a another document management system at</p>
<p>the back it's all in one central place</p>
<p>you can access it from within the</p>
<p>process</p>
<p>and make your decisions from me</p>
<p>thank you for attending today</p>
<p>if there are any questions or any</p>
<p>feedback please send them through</p>
<p>I will send replies as soon as we get</p>
<p>those</p>
<p>and thank you have a great day</p>
