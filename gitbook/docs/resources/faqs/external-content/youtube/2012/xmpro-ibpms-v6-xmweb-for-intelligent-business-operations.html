<summary>Transcript</summary>
<p>this is a short introduction video to</p>
<p>exm Pro and it highlights how exm Pro</p>
<p>enables intelligent business operations</p>
<p>in large and medium organization it is</p>
<p>based on a typical example that</p>
<p>demonstrates the three key elements of</p>
<p>intelligent business operations which</p>
<p>processors need to handle the first of</p>
<p>that being able to handle unstructured</p>
<p>routing which are rules-based rather</p>
<p>than workflow based so that is the</p>
<p>instance where there are no predefined</p>
<p>workflows typically the scenario of</p>
<p>knowledge workers where based on</p>
<p>contextual information you would decide</p>
<p>what the routing is which leads to the</p>
<p>next um point of intelligent business</p>
<p>operations the ability to handle Dynamic</p>
<p>changes uh to the process based on</p>
<p>internal and external contextual</p>
<p>information and then lastly being able</p>
<p>to uh manage and handle social</p>
<p>collaboration in and around</p>
<p>processes with structured workflow you</p>
<p>typically have a challenge where social</p>
<p>collaboration happens with email outside</p>
<p>of the process management solution and</p>
<p>with exm Pro we have built social</p>
<p>collaboration into the process and that</p>
<p>is how we enable intelligent business</p>
<p>operations through exm Pro this is the</p>
<p>web interface of exm pro it is Al also</p>
<p>available in SharePoint Microsoft</p>
<p>Outlook and also for mobile devices as</p>
<p>you can see we have multiple login</p>
<p>providers social providers so you can</p>
<p>log in with a Facebook account Twitter</p>
<p>LinkedIn some line of business</p>
<p>applications like sip if you're on</p>
<p>active directory it'll log you in</p>
<p>through your active directory</p>
<p>credentials but in this instance I'm</p>
<p>going to use a XM Pro username and</p>
<p>password based login so I'm going to log</p>
<p>in as Keith</p>
<p>Miller</p>
<p>and Keith needs to start the bid</p>
<p>management process within our</p>
<p>organization so there's a new bid</p>
<p>Control process uh this is for a large</p>
<p>scale tender and before we can do that</p>
<p>we actually need to put together a bit</p>
<p>committee there's certain business rules</p>
<p>that will dictate how how um the bid</p>
<p>will be put together and one of the</p>
<p>dynamic aspects of a bid is as we gather</p>
<p>more information some of the rules and</p>
<p>governance and compliance requirements</p>
<p>may change so in this instance just as a</p>
<p>uh from a reference point of view this</p>
<p>is the exm pro user interface these are</p>
<p>things that I can start these are my</p>
<p>to-do list task cases</p>
<p>schedules um tracking I can track either</p>
<p>processes that are in in progress or</p>
<p>completed and we have analytics and</p>
<p>dashboards as well showing the</p>
<p>performance of each of the processes if</p>
<p>you want more information on on XM Pro</p>
<p>contact us or one of our partners I'm</p>
<p>going to show you the bid request</p>
<p>process this is a typical form that is</p>
<p>designed inside XM Pro and it's got</p>
<p>Dynamic capability So based on</p>
<p>information in here this may change it</p>
<p>may add or remove certain buttons</p>
<p>so from a a dynamic and unstructured uh</p>
<p>point of view we are able to manage</p>
<p>unstructed</p>
<p>processes if you look at this is the web</p>
<p>interface so if you look at the design</p>
<p>environment the design environment is a</p>
<p>desktop application that can be used to</p>
<p>author on premise and XM Cloud so our</p>
<p>hosted Cloud environment XM Cloud uh to</p>
<p>to configure processes on on any of</p>
<p>those so in this in</p>
<p>I'm going to look at a at that same</p>
<p>process I'm going to look at the market</p>
<p>and sell and I'm going to look at</p>
<p>Opportunity management as you'll see</p>
<p>from our from our representation here</p>
<p>this model is</p>
<p>a there's no flows drawn between any of</p>
<p>this this is just a container the</p>
<p>container is opportunity management of</p>
<p>which bid management is the start of the</p>
<p>process the new bit Control process and</p>
<p>from there it can flow to any one of</p>
<p>these there are no pred defined flows so</p>
<p>we have a collection of events and I can</p>
<p>add new events to that in this design</p>
<p>environment without having to build</p>
<p>complex uh routing logic we have Dynamic</p>
<p>allocation logic which will</p>
<p>automatically assist you to rout</p>
<p>functionality in a in order to do uh</p>
<p>quite a number of things I'm going to</p>
<p>start opportunity for a new company</p>
<p>called Osco we are we would like to um</p>
<p>tender on that and in this instance what</p>
<p>you'll see is at the moment it doesn't</p>
<p>force me to go to a bid committee if I</p>
<p>put in a value of</p>
<p>$10,000 you'll see that there's</p>
<p>still uh I still have the option to</p>
<p>manually do that uh the the business</p>
<p>rules say that if it's a new customer</p>
<p>there's a certain segment it's a new</p>
<p>technology and it's above a certain</p>
<p>value then then uh it will force me to</p>
<p>go to a bid committee if I change that</p>
<p>value to $50,000 $50,000 in this</p>
<p>example then it'll automatically all</p>
<p>force me to go to a bit committee it</p>
<p>doesn't say that I have to do it right</p>
<p>now but one of the governance and</p>
<p>compliance checks for this process will</p>
<p>be before I can complete the process</p>
<p>that it will be needed to or it'll need</p>
<p>to be submitted to a bid uh committee</p>
<p>dat so we'd like to submit that then and</p>
<p>information that we're going to update</p>
<p>back to our CRM is that we we think that</p>
<p>they are going to buy around about that</p>
<p>time uh opportunity assessment I can</p>
<p>attach documents these documents can be</p>
<p>stored in either SharePoint or your</p>
<p>document management system or in a file</p>
<p>based um solution and in this instance</p>
<p>I'm just going to the the standard exm</p>
<p>profile uh filebase Solutions in this</p>
<p>instance I'm just going to upload the</p>
<p>assessment that we have done uh for Osco</p>
<p>so that's one of the documents I can</p>
<p>have additional supporting documents and</p>
<p>I can add additional line items as you</p>
<p>can see so we can have Header</p>
<p>information line information uh multiple</p>
<p>lines you can add and remove I'm not</p>
<p>going to add any right there I can</p>
<p>have questions that need to be completed</p>
<p>uh in order for this to happen so as you</p>
<p>can see I've uploaded a document and in</p>
<p>this instance I'm going to send it I</p>
<p>have contextual information I've heard</p>
<p>something around Osco on the news and I</p>
<p>just want to have a credit check before</p>
<p>we're going to spend all this money on</p>
<p>the setting up a a bid committee and all</p>
<p>that um so as a knowledge worker I am</p>
<p>not forced to go in a specific route I'm</p>
<p>just going to ask for credit check at</p>
<p>that point in time and as you'll see</p>
<p>it's now gone to the finance group so</p>
<p>there's three or four or five people in</p>
<p>this Finance group um that that can act</p>
<p>on this I'm going to log in as one of</p>
<p>the people in the finance group and once</p>
<p>again I'm just going to use the XM Pro</p>
<p>login and I know that Mark Smith uh</p>
<p>Works in that group so he's one of five</p>
<p>people in a finance</p>
<p>group so um it's under market and sale</p>
<p>products and services</p>
<p>if it's a large list of outstanding</p>
<p>tasks it's quite easy to filter and sort</p>
<p>um in in a large U numbers I I can have</p>
<p>a look at what was done so before I</p>
<p>accept this task for myself I can have a</p>
<p>look at the</p>
<p>history and I can see what was completed</p>
<p>in step</p>
<p>one and based on that I will assign it</p>
<p>to myself so now it removes it of the</p>
<p>rest of the people in that group and it</p>
<p>now now only sits with</p>
<p>me so as you can see from a dynamic</p>
<p>point of view at the moment this is not</p>
<p>reviewed so there's only one option on</p>
<p>the screen uh and from so from a</p>
<p>controll and governance point of view we</p>
<p>can we can still make sure that at</p>
<p>certain point only certain steps can</p>
<p>happen in this instance the $50,000 is</p>
<p>actually us and we want to convert from</p>
<p>US Dollars to Australian</p>
<p>dollars and we will use external web</p>
<p>service in this instance so it'll</p>
<p>convert the 50,000 to a uh using that</p>
<p>currency exchange rate from a web</p>
<p>service and that equal to</p>
<p>$47,000 which we need to submit to our</p>
<p>credit guys for credit approval before</p>
<p>we do that so as you can see it's not</p>
<p>reviewed yet I'm going to send it to a</p>
<p>credit uh service and they will come</p>
<p>back with a score uh once again that's</p>
<p>the external web service and that brings</p>
<p>back a score of 79 data integration can</p>
<p>be done through to any line of business</p>
<p>application that has got integration</p>
<p>capabilities um to external web services</p>
<p>to SharePoint lists so from an</p>
<p>integration point of view we have a</p>
<p>whole lot as you can see it's now also</p>
<p>changed this to a positive review so now</p>
<p>that the credit check has been done and</p>
<p>there's a positive review for this so I</p>
<p>can submit this and it'll now go</p>
<p>back to set up a bit committee this is</p>
<p>the next step that's recommended after</p>
<p>the step after the credit check has been</p>
<p>done and I will log in as one of the</p>
<p>people in the bid</p>
<p>committee so I know that</p>
<p>Tim is one of the bid committee</p>
<p>members and in his list of tasks to</p>
<p>do we</p>
<p>have the bid and it's come through from</p>
<p>Mark so once again if he wants to</p>
<p>see</p>
<p>um the history of that before I do that</p>
<p>I would actually just</p>
<p>like to have a conversation around this</p>
<p>so I'm just going to say</p>
<p>any</p>
<p>info on</p>
<p>Oz uh and the company was called</p>
<p>Osco and on Osco so this is a social</p>
<p>conversation that I'm starting I can do</p>
<p>it with a specific user that is part of</p>
<p>this bit committee group or I can just</p>
<p>send out uh does</p>
<p>anyone know of them and uh so this is a</p>
<p>message that is associated with this</p>
<p>process now having a look at this uh I</p>
<p>will assign it to myself so I can once</p>
<p>again see the history I can see how it</p>
<p>got to me so if I look at the history I</p>
<p>can see uh you can see there's the</p>
<p>conversation that I've just entered into</p>
<p>the process I can see how the from a</p>
<p>history perspective how it got to me and</p>
<p>I can say assign that so now this</p>
<p>activity sits with me and as you can see</p>
<p>this opens up a whole new screen with a</p>
<p>whole lot of features that that uh</p>
<p>supports intelligent business operations</p>
<p>we have covered how we handle</p>
<p>unstructured and dynamic routing options</p>
<p>in here um from a from a intelligent</p>
<p>business operations point of view you</p>
<p>want to enable knowledge workers to make</p>
<p>the best decision and take the next best</p>
<p>action that they can uh one of the</p>
<p>challenges that you find with</p>
<p>conventional systems is is that you</p>
<p>still have to go off to a third party</p>
<p>application to and look at your bi tools</p>
<p>to understand where you are with this um</p>
<p>intelligent business operations features</p>
<p>of of X and pro you can actually embed</p>
<p>the graphs right into your your your bi</p>
<p>information right into the step that I</p>
<p>need to do the the the step that I need</p>
<p>to take in here as you can see this is a</p>
<p>assessment of the opportunity uh the</p>
<p>current opportunity is that green one</p>
<p>over there so in terms of risk it's a</p>
<p>fairly lowrisk project and the</p>
<p>probability pretty high and that's the</p>
<p>value so this can dynamically change as</p>
<p>risk information gets entered into</p>
<p>another system this can move the bubble</p>
<p>around so you can see where this project</p>
<p>sit relative to other projects so as</p>
<p>soon as I looking at who I need to</p>
<p>assign this can have an impact on</p>
<p>resource scheduling uh which we'll cover</p>
<p>over there but there's still some more</p>
<p>information that I would like to have</p>
<p>before I make a decision ision and one</p>
<p>of those are looking at process goals so</p>
<p>in this</p>
<p>example um I can see that my current</p>
<p>sales budget I can see I'm why under in</p>
<p>terms of sales budget and this is the</p>
<p>funnel coming out of the external CRM</p>
<p>solution it can be uh on premise or</p>
<p>cloud-based uh information this can be</p>
<p>uh external web feeds it can be a a</p>
<p>Google or Bing map with superimposed</p>
<p>points in terms of where Vehicles might</p>
<p>be where um aircraft tracking or</p>
<p>whatever it is that you want in terms of</p>
<p>of process goals now process goals span</p>
<p>over a process where this is inside a</p>
<p>transaction so this is specific to the</p>
<p>step in the transaction and this will</p>
<p>span across every single person who is</p>
<p>part of this will drive to the same</p>
<p>outcomes or the same process goal so you</p>
<p>can set certain process goal parameters</p>
<p>in here so that's the those are two of</p>
<p>the components the last component that</p>
<p>we'd like to do is actually to have um</p>
<p>to look at what what is the next based</p>
<p>action so let's have a quick look at</p>
<p>this next based action in this example</p>
<p>we are actually just looking at the</p>
<p>number of times a certain process we</p>
<p>followed so on the right hand side we've</p>
<p>got legal review finance and recast and</p>
<p>we also look at based on these certain</p>
<p>these exact same conditions what did</p>
<p>people do with uh in in that specific</p>
<p>scenario so 17 people sent it for</p>
<p>recasting so uh you can build what</p>
<p>scenarios you can build a lot more</p>
<p>complex next next best actions you can</p>
<p>build your business GPS and advise</p>
<p>people uh what the next best action so</p>
<p>the combination of the next best action</p>
<p>the process goals and the inflight</p>
<p>analytics gives you an unbelievable</p>
<p>opportunity to advise people on their</p>
<p>actions you can do resource scheduling</p>
<p>out of XM Pro there's a whole number of</p>
<p>ways to build list this is for example</p>
<p>people uh in the existing system and</p>
<p>once again this is a typical uh example</p>
<p>of a intelligent form that you can build</p>
<p>with information from external services</p>
<p>and as you can see the green bubble in</p>
<p>this bubble chart part of the dynamic</p>
<p>component of what XM Pro does this is</p>
<p>really just a a short uh introduction in</p>
<p>terms of what it can do there's a whole</p>
<p>lot of other functionality and I really</p>
<p>suggest that you talk to um either</p>
<p>ourselves or one of our partners to see</p>
<p>some of the other functionality inside</p>
<p>XM pro thank you for your time</p>
