<summary>Transcript</summary>thank you and welcome to this webinar
<p>which introduces x-impro version 6 which</p>
<p>is we feel the next generation of</p>
<p>intelligent business process management</p>
<p>switch suites for intelligent business</p>
<p>operations and i'll explain as we go</p>
<p>what we mean by that</p>
<p>and we actually sort of see it as ibus</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>our intelligent business operation suite</p>
<p>so exam pro bank forward</p>
<p>is has grown from from version five and</p>
<p>the features that we'll be covering</p>
<p>today are essentially what we call</p>
<p>version six ibus features i'm not</p>
<p>covering the basic bpm functionality</p>
<p>you can ask one of you can ask us or one</p>
<p>of our partners to do a full</p>
<p>presentation on the powerful features of</p>
<p>xm pro</p>
<p>that it's got currently in</p>
<p>up to version five all the standard</p>
<p>process management workflow what we'll</p>
<p>be focusing on today is really what</p>
<p>makes</p>
<p>version six the ideal platform</p>
<p>for your intelligent business operations</p>
<p>and what does it mean in the first place</p>
<p>and to understand a little bit more of</p>
<p>what intelligent business operations</p>
<p>mean i just like to touch very quickly</p>
<p>on something that i picked up</p>
<p>from garten at the gardener id expo and</p>
<p>essentially</p>
<p>what janelle hill was saying</p>
<p>is that</p>
<p>right now we are right now in business</p>
<p>there's so much</p>
<p>there's newer technologies including</p>
<p>social media context aware technologies</p>
<p>cloud environments intelligent phones</p>
<p>and devices and all of these rev and</p>
<p>revolutionize the way that we work so</p>
<p>the way that we work is actually</p>
<p>changing</p>
<p>and what gartner is saying is</p>
<p>enterprises have not yet empowered</p>
<p>frontline employees to dynamically</p>
<p>adjust their work in progress</p>
<p>in response to the contextual</p>
<p>opportunities or threats and</p>
<p>software has barely been applied to</p>
<p>knowledge centric work</p>
<p>decision making</p>
<p>risk assessments pattern seeking</p>
<p>matching</p>
<p>group collaboration all of those have</p>
<p>been supported as point solutions up to</p>
<p>now but there's been nothing that brings</p>
<p>it all together</p>
<p>and right now</p>
<p>with the leading economies that are</p>
<p>increasingly dependent on service based</p>
<p>industries</p>
<p>it's becoming heavily dependent on</p>
<p>knowledge work information and knowledge</p>
<p>workers and these people are overwhelmed</p>
<p>with data and choices that's where we</p>
<p>find ourselves and most of our customers</p>
<p>at the moment so</p>
<p>what is business and</p>
<p>what is intelligent business operations</p>
<p>to me it's a state of business it's not</p>
<p>really something you can buy it's not a</p>
<p>methodology it's really just a state of</p>
<p>where the business is it's almost like</p>
<p>the bpm maturity curve or any one of</p>
<p>those maturity curves that takes you</p>
<p>from a level zero to a level five</p>
<p>intelligent business operation is a</p>
<p>state in that process</p>
<p>and the way that we achieve that is by</p>
<p>leveraging some of these things that are</p>
<p>now available and when you look at them</p>
<p>essentially there's three main</p>
<p>components to what i see</p>
<p>intelligent but what gives you the state</p>
<p>of intelligent business operations and</p>
<p>the first one is to</p>
<p>be able to cater for knowledge style</p>
<p>work that means not everything can be</p>
<p>structured</p>
<p>you need to have structured and</p>
<p>unstructured processes in</p>
<p>organizations secondly</p>
<p>those processes also need to be dynamic</p>
<p>so there's a convergence of</p>
<p>of unstructured there's a requirement</p>
<p>for dynamic rules based rather than flow</p>
<p>based workflow driven we would</p>
<p>there's a requirement of event driven</p>
<p>actions and these event-driven actions</p>
<p>are actually working towards a business</p>
<p>goal the kpi</p>
<p>one of your</p>
<p>balanced scorecard</p>
<p>kpis or something like that it includes</p>
<p>predictive analytics it's trying to</p>
<p>understand what have we done in the past</p>
<p>looking at process mining and combining</p>
<p>all of this to be able to</p>
<p>dynamically change</p>
<p>based on the context and the information</p>
<p>that we have at that point in time and</p>
<p>something else that we are all aware of</p>
<p>but we've not been able to capture as</p>
<p>part of as as part of our the way that</p>
<p>we do business is to include those</p>
<p>social conversations around the water</p>
<p>cooler</p>
<p>and they essentially in and around</p>
<p>business transactions what we mean by</p>
<p>that some conversations happens around</p>
<p>business how do we improve ourselves</p>
<p>others happen around</p>
<p>very specific transactions</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>what are the benefits of intelligent</p>
<p>business operations the first one is</p>
<p>really just better business decisions</p>
<p>what we don't want to do is actually</p>
<p>force someone down a a specific path</p>
<p>when they have better contextual informa</p>
<p>when they know the context of a process</p>
<p>all that we want to do is give them as</p>
<p>much information as we can at that point</p>
<p>in time for them to make better</p>
<p>decisions so what we want to do is</p>
<p>empower those knowledge workers and we</p>
<p>want them to act in a non-prescriptive</p>
<p>way</p>
<p>if you take a factory style where</p>
<p>everything works in a very prescriptive</p>
<p>way and it's well worked out and there's</p>
<p>a</p>
<p>a a a</p>
<p>a jet principle or anything like that</p>
<p>just in time um it's it's worked out to</p>
<p>the to the finite element of of what</p>
<p>every work activity should take how long</p>
<p>it should take what the next one is</p>
<p>knowledge workers don't work like that</p>
<p>they don't want to work in a</p>
<p>prescriptive way because they have</p>
<p>contextual knowledge but we still need</p>
<p>to put that into some control framework</p>
<p>we can't just let them loose and do</p>
<p>anything that they want to and in in</p>
<p>exon pro version six we will show you</p>
<p>we'll demonstrate um how we control how</p>
<p>we do some of these</p>
<p>principles that we talk about here</p>
<p>a lot of companies have spent a lot of</p>
<p>money on business intelligence tools but</p>
<p>what you want to do is make those</p>
<p>business intelligence insights</p>
<p>actionable what do you do with the intel</p>
<p>that you're gathering how do you action</p>
<p>it how do you make sure things happen</p>
<p>with it how do you how do you make sure</p>
<p>people look forward and use it rather</p>
<p>than just looking at a rear view mirror</p>
<p>business intelligence dashboards can be</p>
<p>almost like a rear view mirror it shows</p>
<p>you what happened if you want to take if</p>
<p>you want to make it actionable you need</p>
<p>to take those business intelligence</p>
<p>elements those insights and actually</p>
<p>make them part of the process going</p>
<p>forward so that you can actually look</p>
<p>forward instead of looking</p>
<p>backwards and then lastly we will also</p>
<p>the other benefit that we get out of</p>
<p>intelligent business operations is that</p>
<p>we we can actually improve the</p>
<p>collaboration by harnessing the social</p>
<p>interaction now there's many ways of</p>
<p>people socializing and we're trying to</p>
<p>capture some of them as part of the way</p>
<p>that we that we work we want to get</p>
<p>better at getting work done which is</p>
<p>essentially what xmpro is all about so</p>
<p>just once again to to</p>
<p>emphasize the three elements of</p>
<p>intelligent business operations that</p>
<p>exxonpro address is the ability to have</p>
<p>unstructured processes</p>
<p>to have dynamic processes</p>
<p>and to have social processes</p>
<p>as i go through the</p>
<p>the presentation will actually show you</p>
<p>these three elements in terms of how we</p>
<p>handle them in version six so to start</p>
<p>off with unstructured processes and as</p>
<p>you'll recall i said structured and</p>
<p>unstructured processes are there to</p>
<p>support a knowledge style work</p>
<p>gartner has come out and said 80 of work</p>
<p>is unstructured so</p>
<p>and and that is primarily in the</p>
<p>knowledge worker space so this is where</p>
<p>people sales people</p>
<p>customer service</p>
<p>right down to to</p>
<p>financial</p>
<p>office</p>
<p>chief marketing officer office all of</p>
<p>those</p>
<p>processes are actually there's a whole</p>
<p>lot of unstructured work in after fact</p>
<p>we actually find that that there's more</p>
<p>of a hybrid model that 20 percent of a</p>
<p>process</p>
<p>is structured and 80 of a process is</p>
<p>unstructured so we it's not just that</p>
<p>you can discreetly say or or</p>
<p>quite easily define which processes are</p>
<p>are</p>
<p>structured and which are unstructured</p>
<p>you always in many instances you</p>
<p>actually find a combination of those</p>
<p>processes that are that are like that</p>
<p>and what you also find is when you look</p>
<p>at real world business processes there</p>
<p>are generally more exceptions than rules</p>
<p>that means if you're going to try and do</p>
<p>take a workflow based approach where you</p>
<p>draw out the you draw the flow of how</p>
<p>this thing will work you're going to</p>
<p>find that with all the exceptions you're</p>
<p>going to run out of paper</p>
<p>unstructured processes say we have a</p>
<p>collection we have a container</p>
<p>and for a process and we can call that</p>
<p>customer onboarding for example and in</p>
<p>that container we can put all the events</p>
<p>that can that can occur and we can</p>
<p>sequence them as we need them we talk</p>
<p>about we sequence them at runtime rather</p>
<p>than at design time so we don't design</p>
<p>the flows but we do put those process</p>
<p>elements in there</p>
<p>the other one is that knowledge workers</p>
<p>have context people have information and</p>
<p>they make decisions based on that and</p>
<p>based on that they want to determine the</p>
<p>routing so for example a salesperson</p>
<p>will know or may have read or</p>
<p>that there's a issue with a</p>
<p>current</p>
<p>prospect that is going through a um</p>
<p>a customer onboarding process</p>
<p>um they may have read in the paper heard</p>
<p>something on the tv news and what they</p>
<p>want to do is actually do a credit check</p>
<p>right there and then so instead of</p>
<p>waiting for the prescriptive workflow</p>
<p>that says</p>
<p>you have to do it in step six we</p>
<p>actually want to do it right now so</p>
<p>knowledge workers have context what we</p>
<p>want to do is enable them to make better</p>
<p>decisions so</p>
<p>when we look at dynamic and all of those</p>
<p>processes so those elements we will</p>
<p>actually also introduce some of the</p>
<p>analytics</p>
<p>that we have</p>
<p>but right now we just want to make sure</p>
<p>that people have the option</p>
<p>based on the information that they have</p>
<p>to route it to a different place</p>
<p>so if we look at</p>
<p>an unstructured process one of the</p>
<p>challenges that we have found is</p>
<p>knowledge style work</p>
<p>if you use email or any one of those</p>
<p>other</p>
<p>ways and means of trying to manage it</p>
<p>that you actually don't have an order</p>
<p>trial of this knowledge style work you</p>
<p>only you only have order trials</p>
<p>of the discrete workflow based work that</p>
<p>you have but none of this work this</p>
<p>knowledge style because the tools up to</p>
<p>now haven't been able to support that so</p>
<p>if you've got a underlying workflow</p>
<p>engine as the as the driver for your for</p>
<p>your process management</p>
<p>then you can't cater for this knowledge</p>
<p>style work</p>
<p>customer service is a typical style of</p>
<p>this</p>
<p>what we call knowledge style so</p>
<p>it depends on what the customer</p>
<p>what the feedback is</p>
<p>what the possible resolutions are what</p>
<p>the what the routing will be so the</p>
<p>routing is not always discrete you can't</p>
<p>say or predefined that we will always go</p>
<p>down this route it really depends on</p>
<p>feedback information and all of that</p>
<p>that will determine the next step so</p>
<p>that is a case style approach um add-up</p>
<p>data entry uh one of the custom</p>
<p>customers</p>
<p>that we have is a large um</p>
<p>funeral home service</p>
<p>and i have</p>
<p>they receive a broad range of</p>
<p>of data</p>
<p>as part of the onboarding process</p>
<p>information can come</p>
<p>in in</p>
<p>an unstructured way to them so there's</p>
<p>different information around who's going</p>
<p>to pay the bill there's different</p>
<p>arrange information around actual</p>
<p>funeral</p>
<p>arrangement there's different</p>
<p>information around</p>
<p>the deceased details</p>
<p>there's a whole lot of different type of</p>
<p>data and we can't dictate the fashion or</p>
<p>the sequence that we got that we are</p>
<p>actually going to</p>
<p>get that in information so that is also</p>
<p>a case style so at any point in time we</p>
<p>can jump around</p>
<p>and add information to that the other</p>
<p>one</p>
<p>is is social listening so an example of</p>
<p>that is we take we monitor twitter feeds</p>
<p>or something like that</p>
<p>for reputation management and we</p>
<p>and based on that depending on what the</p>
<p>twitter feed actually says someone needs</p>
<p>to read it and then based on that it</p>
<p>needs to be routed by</p>
<p>for action to to to the appropriate</p>
<p>place and that is also an unstructured</p>
<p>process because it's really dependent on</p>
<p>what the information also what the what</p>
<p>the initial</p>
<p>message was and how we take it through</p>
<p>the resolution process even inside that</p>
<p>resolution process there's multiple</p>
<p>options depending on what the outcomes</p>
<p>are so this is those are typical</p>
<p>unstructured processes that we find</p>
<p>ourselves working in</p>
<p>if we look at a quick example of</p>
<p>what we call a</p>
<p>unstructured process in version 6</p>
<p>i'm just going to hand over the</p>
<p>keyboard here quickly to</p>
<p>gavin he's got the software and i'll be</p>
<p>talking on that so i just want to pass</p>
<p>it on to him</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>double check that we can see</p>
<p>the right screen great</p>
<p>so as you can see</p>
<p>in order to explain what unstructured</p>
<p>processes look like and i just quickly</p>
<p>want to touch on what a structured</p>
<p>process</p>
<p>typically looks like so</p>
<p>what we've got on the screen is our xm</p>
<p>pro</p>
<p>xm designer so this is where we build</p>
<p>processes and at the back you can see</p>
<p>there's a</p>
<p>physio based diagram and that diagram</p>
<p>has got structured custom onboarding so</p>
<p>you can see there's a discrete flow and</p>
<p>there's a specific path or routing</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>that it</p>
<p>has to step through</p>
<p>those are about those only 20 of</p>
<p>processes that we have in our in in</p>
<p>organization if we look at a typical</p>
<p>unstructured process so the previous one</p>
<p>was customer onboarding and we took a</p>
<p>very structured flow very basic</p>
<p>in this instance what we're looking at</p>
<p>is unstructured of what we call</p>
<p>opportunity management so for example we</p>
<p>so we</p>
<p>we</p>
<p>respond to tenders rfps rfcs all of</p>
<p>those sort of things rfqs</p>
<p>so we we respond to uh to those and we</p>
<p>see those all as opportunities so this</p>
<p>is a sales based process and what you'll</p>
<p>see there's a whole bunch of events now</p>
<p>from x and pro point of view</p>
<p>we now refer to to this canvas that you</p>
<p>see as our process container and we can</p>
<p>add events to that so there's a whole</p>
<p>bunch of events</p>
<p>that we can that we can add</p>
<p>those events are</p>
<p>typically a process starts with</p>
<p>something like start opportunity but</p>
<p>then there's a whole bunch of events we</p>
<p>consider bid committees there's</p>
<p>technical reviews there's actual</p>
<p>proposal presentation there's project</p>
<p>costing there's conducting credit checks</p>
<p>there's</p>
<p>margin approvals also all sorts of</p>
<p>things right now the credit check</p>
<p>uh is is at the end of the process uh</p>
<p>what what gavin's going to do he's just</p>
<p>going to move it</p>
<p>so as you'll see right now</p>
<p>credit check is just one of those</p>
<p>options that will come through</p>
<p>that you can</p>
<p>as part of</p>
<p>the later stages of the actual</p>
<p>process what we're going to do is we're</p>
<p>actually going to</p>
<p>include so we would like to dynamically</p>
<p>to the start process we would</p>
<p>dynamically like to add he's using our</p>
<p>dynamic allocation logic which we call</p>
<p>dull</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>without</p>
<p>drawing flow diagrams or anything like</p>
<p>that you'll see</p>
<p>so as you can see um the credit check</p>
<p>just still sits there as an event</p>
<p>and but if you refresh this you'll see</p>
<p>on the right hand side we now have</p>
<p>credit check</p>
<p>as an option uh without so we've not had</p>
<p>to do any workflow coding or set up a a</p>
<p>specific code for that so this is</p>
<p>opportunity management and in this</p>
<p>in this instance</p>
<p>i'm just going to put in a abn number</p>
<p>there in any number</p>
<p>now there's a couple of business rules</p>
<p>behind this thing that says if it's a</p>
<p>new customer</p>
<p>and it's a new segment and it's new</p>
<p>technology and the value is more than</p>
<p>something then it will always have to go</p>
<p>to a big committee it can't be done by</p>
<p>the salespersons</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you'll see right there it's now it's it</p>
<p>doesn't mean that it has to go to the</p>
<p>bid committee right now you can set it</p>
<p>to do that it just means before this</p>
<p>process will be completed it will have</p>
<p>to be seen by a bit committee if we</p>
<p>change some of the other parameters so</p>
<p>we make the value less and we also say</p>
<p>it's not a new technology and it's not a</p>
<p>new customer</p>
<p>in this instance you will see that i</p>
<p>just make that a</p>
<p>lesser amount what you'll see is that</p>
<p>it's not a that</p>
<p>contributor what the threshold was</p>
<p>that we said in here as you can see the</p>
<p>threshold is probably about five</p>
<p>thousand dollars</p>
<p>um so everything about five thousand</p>
<p>dollars will have to go to a bid</p>
<p>committee it's going to put in some</p>
<p>comments there</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>so on the right hand side the action</p>
<p>items that those are actually</p>
<p>the um</p>
<p>the the the dynamic</p>
<p>buttons that that exam in xm pro version</p>
<p>six what that allows you to do is</p>
<p>dynamically have as many buttons as you</p>
<p>need for a unstructured process so i can</p>
<p>if it's a structured process it'll only</p>
<p>have one button and you can only go one</p>
<p>or two routes if it's dynamic with that</p>
<p>dynamic allocation logic we can actually</p>
<p>expose all of those</p>
<p>elements that were shown on the flow</p>
<p>diagram you can actually expose all of</p>
<p>them what gavin's doing now is just he's</p>
<p>just adding some documents to this so</p>
<p>there's some opportunity documents that</p>
<p>came in with that</p>
<p>so what he's going to do now is actually</p>
<p>send it off</p>
<p>for a credit check because he has</p>
<p>contextual information he knows that he</p>
<p>read something in the paper about this</p>
<p>airline the blue bean airline or</p>
<p>whatever</p>
<p>the um</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>he's now going on to um</p>
<p>logging in as mark smith who is the</p>
<p>financial</p>
<p>controller who actually does the</p>
<p>credit check</p>
<p>so in his to-do list</p>
<p>and the case</p>
<p>he's got a task and in that task</p>
<p>in terms of function as standard process</p>
<p>functionality we're not covering</p>
<p>any of that in this webinar if you want</p>
<p>to understand how the routing the the</p>
<p>options the audit trials the integration</p>
<p>all of that works</p>
<p>then please contact us or one of our</p>
<p>partners and we can demonstrate that to</p>
<p>you so what kevin's doing here let me</p>
<p>just kevin just go back to the top of</p>
<p>the screen so we can just explain</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>i just want to explain um this is the</p>
<p>credit check forms in that it's brought</p>
<p>in information from the previous</p>
<p>screen</p>
<p>there we've got a web service that does</p>
<p>a</p>
<p>a currency conversion before we actually</p>
<p>submit this to dun and bradstreet we</p>
<p>want to so this web service goes off and</p>
<p>uses a web-based service and right now</p>
<p>as of today we're getting 92 australian</p>
<p>cents for one us dollar</p>
<p>which is not great for us exporting from</p>
<p>australia</p>
<p>and so instead the two thousand dollars</p>
<p>from our credit point of view</p>
<p>is now only</p>
<p>1800 that needs to be</p>
<p>approved on on our side what you'll see</p>
<p>is because we've not reviewed it that</p>
<p>button shows not reviewed so i can</p>
<p>submit this and it'll it'll it will</p>
<p>trigger a different</p>
<p>review process if i want if i do the</p>
<p>credit check right now so what it'll do</p>
<p>if you use the web service go to dun and</p>
<p>bradstreet come back give it a credit</p>
<p>score and you'll see in terms of our</p>
<p>business rules this is now a positive</p>
<p>review so that dynamically changes</p>
<p>if you open the case file the documents</p>
<p>that were associated in the previous</p>
<p>steps are all there so you can see the</p>
<p>documents that are now that can be</p>
<p>sharepoint based or they can be</p>
<p>file-based</p>
<p>so that's all stored in there</p>
<p>the positive</p>
<p>review</p>
<p>sort of leads me into all the the change</p>
<p>of the button to positive review</p>
<p>actually leads me into</p>
<p>into the next</p>
<p>component of</p>
<p>what x and pro does if we look at</p>
<p>dynamic processes so as you saw that</p>
<p>button dynamically changed so based on</p>
<p>the context or conditions that button</p>
<p>actually changed so what does dynamic</p>
<p>mean well by dynamic when we say that</p>
<p>that's rules based event driven actions</p>
<p>the example that you saw with a vizio</p>
<p>diagram with all those activities that</p>
<p>were not linked those are all events</p>
<p>that all discrete events each of those</p>
<p>events have their own screen they have</p>
<p>their own data integration they have</p>
<p>their own rules</p>
<p>and we can dynamic or</p>
<p>we can dynamically or</p>
<p>in an unstructured way sequence them</p>
<p>when we need them</p>
<p>a key another key part of it is that</p>
<p>these dynamic</p>
<p>processes</p>
<p>utilize things like predictive analytics</p>
<p>process mining and business intelligence</p>
<p>to make it more goal oriented so</p>
<p>essentially what it does</p>
<p>it provides</p>
<p>agile flexible processes that are still</p>
<p>managed by a set of rules so this is</p>
<p>more a rules-based or</p>
<p>rule engine approach with a whole bunch</p>
<p>of events that can occur</p>
<p>so we still work within rules it's not</p>
<p>just anyone do what they want</p>
<p>especially when you look at compliance</p>
<p>governance those sort of things and so</p>
<p>this rules framework that can</p>
<p>dynamically adjust</p>
<p>uh based on the events of the of the</p>
<p>context of the process like you saw when</p>
<p>we did the credit check</p>
<p>it immediately came back with the credit</p>
<p>score and based on the credit score the</p>
<p>button uh changed and it it actually now</p>
<p>goes down a route for where there was a</p>
<p>positive</p>
<p>approval the other</p>
<p>the other element um which we will</p>
<p>demonstrate uh when we show you some</p>
<p>dynamic processes is the ability to</p>
<p>advise next best action using data</p>
<p>mining and predictive analytics all that</p>
<p>that means is we can go and look at the</p>
<p>historical</p>
<p>or previous processes and say what did</p>
<p>someone do with the same set of</p>
<p>conditions when they had the same set of</p>
<p>conditions</p>
<p>what what was the</p>
<p>what actions were taken at that point in</p>
<p>time so it gives you guidance</p>
<p>and i need to stress it's guidance it</p>
<p>doesn't take over the workflow it</p>
<p>doesn't change the you still have the</p>
<p>ability to make the decision</p>
<p>and that is a key element of of a</p>
<p>of</p>
<p>intelligent business operations you</p>
<p>provide the intelligence to people but</p>
<p>you still rely on them to make those</p>
<p>decisions you have the order trials so</p>
<p>you can see what decisions were made and</p>
<p>that is actually what we use those we</p>
<p>can mine that data and we can actually</p>
<p>use that as part of</p>
<p>of</p>
<p>the ability to advise next best actions</p>
<p>you can also visualize process goals at</p>
<p>each step to guide the work decisions</p>
<p>now those process goals can either be in</p>
<p>the transaction or they can be</p>
<p>overarching for the overall process so</p>
<p>these are kpis every process should have</p>
<p>a kpi it doesn't matter what you do even</p>
<p>if you're doing remuneration</p>
<p>adjustments across the organization you</p>
<p>need there are certain kpis that need to</p>
<p>be um adhered to whether you</p>
<p>um whether it's sales whether it's</p>
<p>procurement whether it's operations it</p>
<p>doesn't matter processes and the best</p>
<p>way of looking at that is actually if</p>
<p>you look at a balanced scorecard balance</p>
<p>scorecard is built all around kpis</p>
<p>it's all around the strategy of the</p>
<p>organization so</p>
<p>that is typically something we would</p>
<p>that we would like to show people</p>
<p>when they are at a work step we don't</p>
<p>want them to go to a analytics dashboard</p>
<p>we want to embed some of those analytics</p>
<p>widgets into the actual process so that</p>
<p>they can see</p>
<p>what it is or what the current context</p>
<p>is and they can make better business</p>
<p>decisions</p>
<p>so when we look at</p>
<p>dynamic processes</p>
<p>they can dynamically change based on</p>
<p>events as i as i described</p>
<p>they are also context aware so it means</p>
<p>if there's a change</p>
<p>in</p>
<p>either internal environment or external</p>
<p>environment that you can manage it and</p>
<p>it's got built-in predictive analytics</p>
<p>so if we look at dynamically what do we</p>
<p>mean by dynamically change on events i</p>
<p>want to give you some examples so for</p>
<p>example we have data rules so it can it</p>
<p>can change based on certain data rules</p>
<p>so we can check</p>
<p>how are we doing against a budget and</p>
<p>when we get to 80 of</p>
<p>of our budget we can introduce</p>
<p>additional approvals or something like</p>
<p>that or on a sales budget as soon as we</p>
<p>hit break even point we we don't allow</p>
<p>discounts anymore um then we want to</p>
<p>maximize profit so the initial part is</p>
<p>is</p>
<p>around budget is actually to get a</p>
<p>just to make our number from a</p>
<p>break-even point of view and then we</p>
<p>want to change the rules and then we</p>
<p>want to maximize profit so that is one</p>
<p>way that a process can change if you</p>
<p>look at</p>
<p>there can be business rules an example</p>
<p>of that is a complex approval matrix</p>
<p>if you've got a</p>
<p>for example a banking client with a</p>
<p>complex approval structure for</p>
<p>procurement where they have 10 or 20 000</p>
<p>people that do procurement and they have</p>
<p>all these hr categories where people fit</p>
<p>in a and b and c and whatever and you</p>
<p>may require that two a's and a b sign</p>
<p>for a specific gl account that's quite a</p>
<p>complex approval matrix the challenge</p>
<p>that you have</p>
<p>and most of this can can be done</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>with with with some basic workflows the</p>
<p>challenge that you have is as soon as</p>
<p>if that complex approval matrix changes</p>
<p>every month like it does in a bank you</p>
<p>have people that move around leave and</p>
<p>new people that join so that whole</p>
<p>complex approval matrix</p>
<p>and with all the emerges and</p>
<p>acquisitions and putting departments</p>
<p>together and taking them apart we have</p>
<p>found that that is a really really hard</p>
<p>thing to manage</p>
<p>if you if you can't dynamically change</p>
<p>the process is based on on that so</p>
<p>that's one example where business rules</p>
<p>have an impact on how you dynamically</p>
<p>want to change it and then</p>
<p>lastly you want to use</p>
<p>social events to be able to change</p>
<p>processes and dynamically or escalate or</p>
<p>drive it to a different user so for</p>
<p>example if i was the insurance company</p>
<p>and i</p>
<p>on twitter put</p>
<p>carjacked help</p>
<p>i was hoping that someone would pick it</p>
<p>up and action it</p>
<p>so and i and based on the fact that it</p>
<p>is a distress word</p>
<p>um it will actually um elevate it other</p>
<p>than just saying xyz insurance companies</p>
<p>suck which is a different problem uh</p>
<p>from a from a social event so yeah</p>
<p>there's a whole number of ways that you</p>
<p>can actually dynamically change</p>
<p>processes</p>
<p>so that just means if you combine that</p>
<p>with unstructured unstructured it says</p>
<p>we don't have to follow a specific path</p>
<p>dynamics says based on context based on</p>
<p>things that i know</p>
<p>we will actually change so when we look</p>
<p>at context</p>
<p>so what happens if the exchange rate</p>
<p>changes you may want to as soon as</p>
<p>there's a exchange rate change you may</p>
<p>want to enforce a whole different set of</p>
<p>rules</p>
<p>and routing and logic</p>
<p>on</p>
<p>on your procurement sales or whatever</p>
<p>the processes are that are all impacted</p>
<p>by exchange rate changes</p>
<p>one one example is safer and and this</p>
<p>was one that i read um i store</p>
<p>storm impact on insurance call center as</p>
<p>soon as there's a big storm what you</p>
<p>want to do is you want to reduce or you</p>
<p>want to streamline that</p>
<p>that process of getting claims through</p>
<p>by just taking out a whole lot of</p>
<p>approvals and and and</p>
<p>complexity in in the process you still</p>
<p>want to have some controls but you just</p>
<p>want to get that call center going</p>
<p>without back without a big backlog</p>
<p>building up in it and then the other the</p>
<p>other context aware thing is so who's</p>
<p>doing the transaction if it's the md of</p>
<p>the organization it may have a</p>
<p>completely different route logic</p>
<p>business rules and everything so it</p>
<p>needs to be context aware around who the</p>
<p>person is that's actually doing the</p>
<p>transaction and based on that it will</p>
<p>prescribe certain rules flows</p>
<p>and even data that it may or may not</p>
<p>show them so that is typically what i</p>
<p>what what</p>
<p>context aware means when we look at</p>
<p>built-in pre predictive analytics it's</p>
<p>really</p>
<p>taking the investment that we've done in</p>
<p>our bi and putting that into the process</p>
<p>why look at bi separately</p>
<p>sort of a rear view mirror approach</p>
<p>and not put it into the actual processor</p>
<p>when someone's doing something for</p>
<p>example on my on my and this is the</p>
<p>example we're quickly going to show you</p>
<p>is when i do a approval for a</p>
<p>for for purchasing i can actually put</p>
<p>the graph out of sap or oracle or</p>
<p>ax or whatever financial system it is</p>
<p>that you use</p>
<p>we can actually put that graph into the</p>
<p>process so you you know immediately</p>
<p>whether you can approve it or not</p>
<p>you can add additional approval steps on</p>
<p>a threshold so what we so so</p>
<p>when that graph approaches 80 of</p>
<p>our budget we can introduce additional</p>
<p>rules or change rules based on that and</p>
<p>we can advise next best actions based on</p>
<p>this</p>
<p>predictive</p>
<p>analytics</p>
<p>this example in actual fact i think one</p>
<p>of the guys on the webinar at the moment</p>
<p>actually works on that</p>
<p>project where from a university</p>
<p>perspective they they get paid based on</p>
<p>grants</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so they get grants based on students</p>
<p>that finish and one of the things that</p>
<p>you want to do that you want to predict</p>
<p>or want to find is actually students</p>
<p>that fall off</p>
<p>or that are showing signs of not</p>
<p>completing courses so you want to look</p>
<p>at and there's such such amount of data</p>
<p>as i said right at the start people are</p>
<p>actually overwhelmed by data so what you</p>
<p>want to do is is take the attendance</p>
<p>records the library records the</p>
<p>canteen records and all of those collate</p>
<p>that information and try and identify</p>
<p>those students that are that are that</p>
<p>are</p>
<p>showing</p>
<p>signs of of of that they will</p>
<p>potentially drop off then you can action</p>
<p>that and start processes to actively try</p>
<p>and engage them in in in the process of</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>getting them back in so that you can um</p>
<p>get your your your grants at the end of</p>
<p>the day the one challenge that you have</p>
<p>with that at some point in time the cost</p>
<p>of trying to get that student back</p>
<p>actually crosses over with the value of</p>
<p>money that you're going to get so from a</p>
<p>business point of view on your dashboard</p>
<p>you'd like to see when do we stop doing</p>
<p>this it's a great approach so it uses a</p>
<p>lot of</p>
<p>all this predictive</p>
<p>analytics and it can put it into the</p>
<p>process we can drive the process we can</p>
<p>try and get them</p>
<p>through consultation and whatever</p>
<p>mechanisms they use but at some point in</p>
<p>time we also need to say well this is</p>
<p>not not worth it so that is typically</p>
<p>applications</p>
<p>for this there are some questions coming</p>
<p>through for the webinar i'll answer them</p>
<p>at the end</p>
<p>so let's give you an example of a</p>
<p>dynamic process</p>
<p>in version 6 of ibos</p>
<p>and i'm just going to once again hand</p>
<p>over to gavin</p>
<p>and make him the presenter so he's got a</p>
<p>keyboard and mouse so as i was saying we</p>
<p>have a purchase</p>
<p>a purchase requisition process so you</p>
<p>can see there's actually three ones open</p>
<p>that's um he's logged in as tim clark</p>
<p>and them as</p>
<p>has got three you chose the first one</p>
<p>which was keith miller so if you look at</p>
<p>the history</p>
<p>you will see that keith was looking to</p>
<p>buy so as you can see xmp pro puts the</p>
<p>previous steps in line so the form so</p>
<p>you can actually see what was ordered</p>
<p>for 9 000</p>
<p>for a server rack</p>
<p>so we can just close the history</p>
<p>and there's a whole other functionality</p>
<p>and once again we can demonstrate that</p>
<p>to you if you're interested in a a</p>
<p>separate</p>
<p>presentation so what you'll see the</p>
<p>graph that has come through actually</p>
<p>draws the data from the financial system</p>
<p>so the erp or whatever you're using and</p>
<p>there's a budget of 22 000 we've spent</p>
<p>12 000 up to now there's another 2 000</p>
<p>currently committed in another</p>
<p>transaction sitting somewhere in the</p>
<p>approval stage and in this one you'll</p>
<p>see the requisition total corresponds</p>
<p>with the</p>
<p>graph element over there so based on</p>
<p>this</p>
<p>i can see that i will probably there's a</p>
<p>good chance of me approving this but i</p>
<p>would actually like to understand how am</p>
<p>i doing</p>
<p>but on my overall</p>
<p>experience management so</p>
<p>if i look at my process goal so the firs</p>
<p>the bottom</p>
<p>graph the budget goal is for that</p>
<p>specific activity for that specific</p>
<p>event that we're doing</p>
<p>the top one is my process goals so that</p>
<p>will stretch over all</p>
<p>for that whole transaction every single</p>
<p>time</p>
<p>you do an event that that graph will</p>
<p>show so in this instance we can see and</p>
<p>you can customize these graphs in the</p>
<p>back end of of x and pro</p>
<p>our designer we have a chart wizard you</p>
<p>build these um drag and drop with fancy</p>
<p>graphics so you don't have to worry</p>
<p>about to do that you know that's the</p>
<p>fact you can embed the widgets</p>
<p>from some of the the bi tools out there</p>
<p>you can actually embed those widgets in</p>
<p>there as well to give you that</p>
<p>information</p>
<p>but in this instance we can see that</p>
<p>we're currently spending in our our</p>
<p>budget is twenty two thousand dollars</p>
<p>sorry um</p>
<p>the budget is seventeen thousand dollars</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>on that oh sorry thousand</p>
<p>seventeen thousand dollars and you can</p>
<p>see our monthly expenditure so i can see</p>
<p>right now for the last three months i</p>
<p>haven't really spent as much as i</p>
<p>as i have previously and i can also see</p>
<p>by department in terms of the three gl</p>
<p>codes that i am responsible for for</p>
<p>approvals i can see</p>
<p>my id expenditure at the moment is the</p>
<p>highest on hr spend the low so those are</p>
<p>kpis or process goals that i can now use</p>
<p>to drive</p>
<p>this process just one more thing that i</p>
<p>want to do i want to see what did other</p>
<p>people do when they were in a similar</p>
<p>position so i can look at the next best</p>
<p>action and what the next best action</p>
<p>does you can put</p>
<p>the checkbox anywhere that you want</p>
<p>but what you can do with the next best</p>
<p>action it will actually say out of the</p>
<p>previous 200 um</p>
<p>200 uh instances of a similar condition</p>
<p>same gel code or whatever the case might</p>
<p>be</p>
<p>what did most people do so based on that</p>
<p>i can see that a good 70 of the time</p>
<p>people actually approved it based on the</p>
<p>current conditions that we have right</p>
<p>now so you can use predictive analytics</p>
<p>to to to drive that um</p>
<p>uh uh</p>
<p>what what it is that</p>
<p>that you're actually going to do so that</p>
<p>gives you sort of a view of what a</p>
<p>a</p>
<p>dynamic process can look like obviously</p>
<p>you saw the the button changing</p>
<p>previously you can add additional</p>
<p>buttons as it goes</p>
<p>but what is really powerful is being</p>
<p>able to advise</p>
<p>and use</p>
<p>the the</p>
<p>predictive approach</p>
<p>and using</p>
<p>the business intelligence that we have</p>
<p>and also visualizing the process goals</p>
<p>and it's all around making better</p>
<p>business decisions with all of this</p>
<p>information we're not taking the ability</p>
<p>away from people to do to make a</p>
<p>decision we just give them as much</p>
<p>information as they need to actually</p>
<p>make good decisions</p>
<p>the last element</p>
<p>that i'd like to</p>
<p>talk about</p>
<p>is</p>
<p>social processes so as you'll recall we</p>
<p>had unstructured processes we had</p>
<p>dynamic processes and lastly what makes</p>
<p>intelligent business operations is</p>
<p>actually to take some of the</p>
<p>conversations</p>
<p>that we have in and around business and</p>
<p>it's</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>so to take the social conversations that</p>
<p>are in</p>
<p>or around the business and its</p>
<p>transactions what we mean by that</p>
<p>is sometimes we want to talk about</p>
<p>process improvement</p>
<p>for example other instances we want to</p>
<p>talk about a specific transaction</p>
<p>and we want to capture all of that</p>
<p>information</p>
<p>the other thing that we want to do is um</p>
<p>we want to be around the business so</p>
<p>when we're in the business we</p>
<p>or in the process itself it is all</p>
<p>around</p>
<p>what happens inside that process or the</p>
<p>transaction</p>
<p>around the business is by monitoring</p>
<p>social channels like what are people</p>
<p>saying on facebook twitter all of those</p>
<p>and turn those tweets into tasks there's</p>
<p>a separate webinar that we did</p>
<p>previously that goes into a lot of</p>
<p>detail showing exactly how the social</p>
<p>listener works and how you do reputation</p>
<p>management with that we also have some</p>
<p>great information coming up</p>
<p>around reputation management and how you</p>
<p>can do it for your organization</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>but right now i'm just going to show you</p>
<p>a very basic example of that what you</p>
<p>also want to do is and and that is so</p>
<p>critical is actually to capture the</p>
<p>social collaboration as part of the</p>
<p>order trial or the decision trail</p>
<p>you don't just want the emails flying</p>
<p>around the processes on the outside you</p>
<p>actually want those social</p>
<p>collaborations to be part of the order</p>
<p>trial so you want to be able to see</p>
<p>what was said why did we approve it</p>
<p>that we couldn't find in the previous</p>
<p>workflow based</p>
<p>approach so let's show you example of</p>
<p>that collaboration in</p>
<p>version six</p>
<p>quickly going to</p>
<p>and once again um</p>
<p>i've got gavin showing uh so i'm not</p>
<p>logged in as as um</p>
<p>as keith miller uh and what he is going</p>
<p>to do is under policy so in this</p>
<p>instance there was a policy control</p>
<p>sorry a policy change process someone</p>
<p>wanted to change</p>
<p>a policy and as part of that so you can</p>
<p>see in the in the history</p>
<p>of that you can see the history and time</p>
<p>and date stamp so this is the standard</p>
<p>history and</p>
<p>you can drag and drop and sort by people</p>
<p>so even with large volumes of</p>
<p>information it's quite easy to find</p>
<p>transactions</p>
<p>what you can see the icon the actual</p>
<p>icons differ so those are traditional</p>
<p>events or activity steps or process</p>
<p>steps and the one with the little orange</p>
<p>components are two people collaborating</p>
<p>and in this instance you'll see so we</p>
<p>had a we had a complete new policy</p>
<p>proposal form then coordinate the policy</p>
<p>proposal and then afterwards</p>
<p>in that step um</p>
<p>tim actually started</p>
<p>sorry keith actually went back and said</p>
<p>tim there's stuff that we need to do now</p>
<p>as you can see this is unstructured um</p>
<p>so these are conversations that become</p>
<p>part of the transaction so the so</p>
<p>when i look at the order trial of the</p>
<p>process</p>
<p>i can actually see the collaboration</p>
<p>around discussions that also was part of</p>
<p>this whole this this whole</p>
<p>approach so it's really a very powerful</p>
<p>way of capturing those</p>
<p>those social interactions and there's</p>
<p>even time and date stamps and all of</p>
<p>those go into the</p>
<p>full order trial so there's full time</p>
<p>and date stamps what is nice about this</p>
<p>is we can put some bi over this</p>
<p>and start looking at who are the social</p>
<p>collaborators should we actually include</p>
<p>them in the formal process or not</p>
<p>um and those are really business</p>
<p>decisions there's some uh</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>social</p>
<p>collaboration aspect</p>
<p>people can either be decisions sorry</p>
<p>they can be influencers</p>
<p>by by providing information or they can</p>
<p>be silent approvers you want to you want</p>
<p>to use your bi tools and actually go and</p>
<p>have a look at that</p>
<p>the other thing that you can do with bi</p>
<p>on unstructured processes while gavin's</p>
<p>opening this up what you can do with bi</p>
<p>on unstructured processes is actually</p>
<p>look at what is the real path that</p>
<p>people follow not the path that we</p>
<p>thought they followed but that's great</p>
<p>that's the other great thing with bi on</p>
<p>top of unstructured processes lastly i</p>
<p>just want to touch on</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>we have a twitter feed and that twitter</p>
<p>feed um picked up</p>
<p>example as a tag</p>
<p>um so with our social listener some</p>
<p>manthan said uh</p>
<p>said something he's watching the the the</p>
<p>webinar now what you want to do with</p>
<p>those you want to turn to tasks into</p>
<p>tweets now once again this is dynamic</p>
<p>and unstructured so depending on what he</p>
<p>wrote we</p>
<p>might want to send it either to customer</p>
<p>service to bookings to other bookings</p>
<p>was actually example that we used with</p>
<p>um with qanas so</p>
<p>depending on what it is that</p>
<p>that is saying we actually have a whole</p>
<p>bunch of</p>
<p>possible actions that can come out of</p>
<p>this and we can drive that dynamically</p>
<p>so we can listen</p>
<p>socially</p>
<p>as well</p>
<p>and then lastly i just want to want him</p>
<p>to log out as you'll see from a social</p>
<p>perspective xm pro version 6 has also</p>
<p>introduced the ability to log in using</p>
<p>facebook</p>
<p>you can use your gmail account your</p>
<p>windows live account linkedin twitter</p>
<p>yahoo and also other business</p>
<p>proprietary ones like sap</p>
<p>so we from a social perspective</p>
<p>processes are not limited to the</p>
<p>enterprise anymore it's on facebook as</p>
<p>well so</p>
<p>we'll be showing you our facebook app in</p>
<p>the not do to this in the future and</p>
<p>also show you how</p>
<p>you can actually run processes inside</p>
<p>the social world of facebook</p>
<p>just going to grab the screen back from</p>
<p>gavin</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>what we've shown you with version 6 is</p>
<p>that we can make better business</p>
<p>decisions</p>
<p>because we have context-based</p>
<p>information it can change dynamically we</p>
<p>show all this information on the screen</p>
<p>so we show all the business intelligence</p>
<p>predictive analytics all of that on the</p>
<p>screen that helps people to make better</p>
<p>business decisions which is a key a key</p>
<p>challenge for business right now it</p>
<p>empowers these knowledge workers to do</p>
<p>what they know best but still within a</p>
<p>governance framework that suits us</p>
<p>and it makes these business intelligence</p>
<p>insights actionable a lot of people have</p>
<p>spent a lot of money on bi and now we</p>
<p>take those things that you learn out of</p>
<p>that and actually turn those into</p>
<p>actions and it improves collaboration by</p>
<p>harnessing the social interaction that</p>
<p>means</p>
<p>uh we can capture those conversations</p>
<p>that we have</p>
<p>it's all about it's better business</p>
<p>outcomes so we can manage our kpis</p>
<p>xm pro version 6 gives you better</p>
<p>control of knowledge work</p>
<p>so you've got older trials of that it's</p>
<p>a better experience for the knowledge</p>
<p>workers because we're not forcing</p>
<p>forcing them down a specific route we</p>
<p>we empower them to still make</p>
<p>intelligent business decisions and in</p>
<p>the end this all means a lower cost of</p>
<p>business operations</p>
<p>thank you very much i see there's a</p>
<p>couple of questions</p>
<p>i'll just address this um</p>
<p>there's a question around if the input</p>
<p>from one business process is required as</p>
<p>input to another process how is this</p>
<p>supported in an unstructured process or</p>
<p>is this by definition what it</p>
<p>that that it is a structured sequential</p>
<p>process if the information um thanks</p>
<p>it's a great question if the information</p>
<p>from one process from one activity is</p>
<p>required in the other um it is quite it</p>
<p>you can still do that in a in a in a</p>
<p>dynamic way so</p>
<p>you can i'm trying to think how to</p>
<p>explain this from my</p>
<p>and not having the software open in</p>
<p>front of me to to do that</p>
<p>xmpro has the ability that you can</p>
<p>interrogate any previous activity from a</p>
<p>from the one that you're in right now to</p>
<p>interrogate what information it contains</p>
<p>at that point in time so even though i</p>
<p>can write it unstructured when this</p>
<p>event that i'm in right now requires</p>
<p>information that was captured in a</p>
<p>previous event i can interrogate that</p>
<p>previous</p>
<p>previous event from this one</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>it does not imply that it's a that it's</p>
<p>a structured sequential process</p>
<p>but you also need to look at this from a</p>
<p>practical point of view when you design</p>
<p>processes to say well if i'm going to</p>
<p>have an event that is that requires</p>
<p>information from my previous event</p>
<p>then i will need to make sure that the</p>
<p>previous event happened in the</p>
<p>prior to the one that i'm in right now</p>
<p>uh it may not be in a structured way you</p>
<p>may still have you still might do it in</p>
<p>a in an unstructured way so there there</p>
<p>may be multiple options of getting to</p>
<p>the one to the activity where i am right</p>
<p>now but if it does require information</p>
<p>um then</p>
<p>then you will just need to make sure</p>
<p>from a logical approach that that</p>
<p>initial one um</p>
<p>occurred i hope that answers your</p>
<p>question if not we can we can actually</p>
<p>show you um how it works what you'll</p>
<p>find with a lot of processes</p>
<p>is actually that there's a hybrid model</p>
<p>so the 80 20 as i said right at the</p>
<p>start twenty percent of the process of a</p>
<p>process twenty percent happens at the</p>
<p>start</p>
<p>which is the sort of the structured</p>
<p>let's log a request do a requisition do</p>
<p>something like that and then it goes</p>
<p>into the eighty percent of well let</p>
<p>someone decide what the next action is</p>
<p>and then it may actually go back into a</p>
<p>structured process in the end so</p>
<p>that in itself because it becomes a</p>
<p>hybrid is a is a by definition by</p>
<p>definition and unstructured process even</p>
<p>though it has</p>
<p>structured elements built into it so</p>
<p>that's one way of</p>
<p>doing it</p>
<p>sequential processes are something where</p>
<p>you redefine all the steps</p>
<p>and you actually draw a flow</p>
<p>in a</p>
<p>unstructured process you can still have</p>
<p>rules that determine sequencing but but</p>
<p>it but it means</p>
<p>but you don't have to draw the error so</p>
<p>i hope that that answers</p>
<p>your question if there are any more</p>
<p>questions um please</p>
<p>feel free to contact myself</p>
<p>or any one of our partners and we'd be</p>
<p>happy to show you how we do this</p>
<p>thank you for your time</p>
