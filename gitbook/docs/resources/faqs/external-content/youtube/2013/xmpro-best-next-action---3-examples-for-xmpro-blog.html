<p>This short video demonstrate 3 different styles of Best Next Actions in XMPro</p>
<p>&quot;Best Next Actions&quot; is a powerful feature to advise the best step based on external data, what people previously did under the same circumstances, or if used with the XMAnalyzer, to find the most profitable, least cost, optimized path.</p>
<p>Instead of &quot;taking over&quot; the process, it will advise the Best Next Action. Users can still decide not to follow a suggested route based on other information that they may have based on their experience.</p>

<summary>Transcript</summary>in this short video I will demonstrate
<p>three different styles of best next</p>
<p>actions in XM Pro I'm currently logged</p>
<p>in as Tim Clark who's the sales manager</p>
<p>and if I look at Tim's to-do list or</p>
<p>task list under the market and sell</p>
<p>products and services</p>
<p>category you'll see that there are</p>
<p>currently two transactions waiting for</p>
<p>him to do two items requiring his</p>
<p>attention</p>
<p>Tim can have a look and see how it got</p>
<p>to him so in the order Trail as it</p>
<p>builds up the order Trail he can see</p>
<p>that it was started by Keith and went on</p>
<p>to Jim and it even includes the XM Pro</p>
<p>social discussions component this is</p>
<p>covered in a different video and I</p>
<p>suggest that you have a look at that in</p>
<p>terms of how discussions can be part of</p>
<p>the transactional order Trail to get</p>
<p>back to the best next actions Tim Needs</p>
<p>to decide on one of the four options on</p>
<p>the right hand inside exm Pros</p>
<p>event-based architecture allows you to</p>
<p>call events like these independently and</p>
<p>they are not wired together at the back</p>
<p>through</p>
<p>workflow now we can embed what we call</p>
<p>inflight analytics to use exm Pro</p>
<p>transactional information or to use</p>
<p>third party transactional information to</p>
<p>help you with the decision so this</p>
<p>information can come from exm Pro</p>
<p>information or any third party business</p>
<p>bus application that you may have</p>
<p>another way of providing some decision</p>
<p>support is to provide some process goals</p>
<p>now these goals follow the process as it</p>
<p>steps through the transaction in this</p>
<p>instance we're looking at information</p>
<p>from the Erp budget to see where we are</p>
<p>currently with our sales um for the</p>
<p>quarter for example and we're also</p>
<p>looking at what is our Prospect pipeline</p>
<p>look like from the external CRM solution</p>
<p>once again this can be ex prob based</p>
<p>information or it can be external</p>
<p>information that will help you with</p>
<p>deciding on what what the next step is</p>
<p>the last component and we will show you</p>
<p>three different examples of this B next</p>
<p>is to look at what the system tells you</p>
<p>what the best next action is and in this</p>
<p>instance it looks at the previous</p>
<p>occurrences this is a simple algorithm a</p>
<p>simple formula it just looks at what</p>
<p>people did before me and out of the 250</p>
<p>odd transactions in here I can see that</p>
<p>the advised action is to do a legal</p>
<p>review so that will allow me if I'm a</p>
<p>new employee or someone uh that needs</p>
<p>guidance that that doesn't know any</p>
<p>other context or don't have any other</p>
<p>information to choose a legal review the</p>
<p>system doesn't make the decision for you</p>
<p>it purely advises what you should do</p>
<p>next because you may still have</p>
<p>information at hand that</p>
<p>will for take you to either do a finance</p>
<p>check or to do recasting you may have</p>
<p>heard something around the credit status</p>
<p>of the customer and decide to look at a</p>
<p>credit check rather than to do a legal</p>
<p>review let's look at another example a</p>
<p>different style example and in this</p>
<p>instance I'm going to log in as John</p>
<p>Smith and John has a different if I look</p>
<p>at his</p>
<p>cases under Life Sciences he's got a</p>
<p>completely different style so in this</p>
<p>instance there's donor verified donor</p>
<p>information this is in the medical area</p>
<p>or uh uh life sciences area and in this</p>
<p>instance when we look at his best next</p>
<p>action so he's got certain information</p>
<p>here and based on that it's either refer</p>
<p>to a specialist um approve the</p>
<p>enrollment get more information or</p>
<p>reject it so his best next action based</p>
<p>on information that is currently filled</p>
<p>in on the screen there's a risk rating</p>
<p>calculation that we do so this best next</p>
<p>action is algorithm driv</p>
<p>driven and the algorithm will</p>
<p>then determine what the current risk</p>
<p>profile is based on a number of</p>
<p>parameters and it also tells us if we</p>
<p>look at a th transactions that happened</p>
<p>before this if we look at the history</p>
<p>only</p>
<p>9.73% of users were approved for this so</p>
<p>based on the risk profile and the trend</p>
<p>of this not being approved the best next</p>
<p>action once again is uh suggested not</p>
<p>enforced so in this instance it is</p>
<p>reject enrollment there might still be</p>
<p>contextual information information that</p>
<p>this case officer knows and as a result</p>
<p>of that they may want to refer it to a</p>
<p>specialist rather to than to reject it</p>
<p>outright so that is the second example</p>
<p>of best next action the last example</p>
<p>example that I'd like to show</p>
<p>you is and you can log in with any one</p>
<p>of the providers I just use the exm pro</p>
<p>authentication for the</p>
<p>demonstration so if I log in as Ted Ted</p>
<p>is a financial manager and he has got a</p>
<p>task waiting for him around procurement</p>
<p>so there's author uh approval uh for a</p>
<p>new supplier and in this instance we</p>
<p>actually we've done a ofac review in</p>
<p>terms of the foreign individuals looking</p>
<p>at some a new supplier that we want to</p>
<p>do business with and in this instance</p>
<p>there was a initial lodgment of the</p>
<p>request and some of the information that</p>
<p>have come back from the web services</p>
<p>search that we've done against the ofac</p>
<p>database has returned some information</p>
<p>now this is not a direct match so in</p>
<p>this instance it was referred to um Ted</p>
<p>to have a review and what Ted will do is</p>
<p>run through a</p>
<p>algorithm uh uh sort of a best practices</p>
<p>and and there's certain information that</p>
<p>based on the correctness of the</p>
<p>information he will answer yes or no yes</p>
<p>or no and if for example if he answers</p>
<p>yes it will direct him to request a</p>
<p>concession suggest that if I go back and</p>
<p>I say no and I say yes over here it will</p>
<p>say report to the ofac hotline so that's</p>
<p>the other one or if that is a no you</p>
<p>will see that this is approved for</p>
<p>onboarding so you can put a logical</p>
<p>algorithm here as well it doesn't just</p>
<p>have to be databased it can help as a</p>
<p>decision support system for someone to</p>
<p>decide what the next best action is</p>
<p>thank you very much for your time and I</p>
<p>hope to see you in one of our other</p>
<p>videos</p>
