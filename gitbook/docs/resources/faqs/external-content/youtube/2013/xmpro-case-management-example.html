<p>XMPro iBOS Case Management example demonstrates how XMPro event-based approach address case management. XMPro iBPMS is a Business Operations Platform that supports both case management and workflow in a single tool.</p>
<p>This Bid Management example is a sales process with integration to Salesforce that demonstrates the typical &quot;unstructured&quot; approach of sales processes. These processes are nearly impossible to draw in a flow diagram and the next step emerges as the process evolves.</p>
<p>The video demonstrates the adaptive nature of XMPro and how to add additional steps or events without any flow lines or coding.</p>

<details>
<summary>Transcript</summary>this is a brief example of a case-based
<p>bid management process this is often</p>
<p>referred to as an unstructured process</p>
<p>as the flow is not really defined up</p>
<p>front and the next step will emerge as</p>
<p>you complete the current one it uses XM</p>
<p>Pro's unique event-based architecture</p>
<p>and before we look at a process example</p>
<p>let's have a quick look at what the</p>
<p>process model behind it looks like so</p>
<p>this is the XM Pro Design environment</p>
<p>and in it used by business Champions and</p>
<p>process analysts to create either</p>
<p>workflows or event based processes and</p>
<p>in this example we will focus on the bid</p>
<p>management process which is an event</p>
<p>based or</p>
<p>case-based uh process so if I just</p>
<p>double click on the market and sub</p>
<p>products and services I will look at</p>
<p>Opportunity management as you can see</p>
<p>there's versioning inside this but what</p>
<p>is what is um evident from this model is</p>
<p>that uh these are independent events</p>
<p>that can occur and that is the event</p>
<p>based architecture if I wanted to do a</p>
<p>workflow I could draw arrows between</p>
<p>this and that will enforce a workflow</p>
<p>but from a casebase or unstructured</p>
<p>point of view um a typical bid process</p>
<p>tends to The Next Step will emerge as</p>
<p>you do the current one so what we don't</p>
<p>want to do is enforce what the flows are</p>
<p>we will use business rules to set up uh</p>
<p>guard rails and we'll touch on that as</p>
<p>we step through the example so let's go</p>
<p>back to the example itself</p>
<p>this is the exm pro um end user front</p>
<p>end so this is one of them uh I'm just</p>
<p>going to log in as</p>
<p>Keith in</p>
<p>here uh this is the webbased front end</p>
<p>there's also Outlook</p>
<p>Salesforce and um SharePoint and also</p>
<p>mobile so any process that you see here</p>
<p>is automatically rendered you don't have</p>
<p>to do anything else to get it to render</p>
<p>as a mobile process as a mobile process</p>
<p>or mobile user interface what you'll see</p>
<p>from this and what makes case base</p>
<p>processes unique is that those are all</p>
<p>those independent tasks so these are</p>
<p>some of them so some of the ones that</p>
<p>you see here we've actually allocated to</p>
<p>do um to to to this activity and I can</p>
<p>choose each one of these they are</p>
<p>independent and they're not they are not</p>
<p>workflow to this one at the back later</p>
<p>on towards the end of the example I will</p>
<p>show you how I dynamically add another</p>
<p>activity to this</p>
<p>so let's look at this example uh the</p>
<p>first thing I'm going to do is to read</p>
<p>some data from an external data uh</p>
<p>source and in this instance I'm using</p>
<p>Salesforce so it uses the XM Pro connect</p>
<p>the the XM Pro connector interrogate and</p>
<p>it goes off and brings information back</p>
<p>from the cloud-based um Salesforce in</p>
<p>this example so what it'll do it'll read</p>
<p>some information off there and bring</p>
<p>back some of the CRM information now the</p>
<p>same with that we read we can write back</p>
<p>from this case point of view um the one</p>
<p>thing with with unstructured processes</p>
<p>as you can see here is that they're</p>
<p>still not uncontrolled it's really</p>
<p>important to understand that</p>
<p>unstructured doesn't mean uncontrolled</p>
<p>from a business rules point of view we</p>
<p>can still put up guard rails to make</p>
<p>sure that certain things happen um with</p>
<p>inside the compliance requirements of</p>
<p>our business so in this example uh we</p>
<p>will look if it's a new customer and the</p>
<p>uh and it's a new Target segment and</p>
<p>it's a new technology and the</p>
<p>opportunity value exceeds a certain</p>
<p>number there's a business rule that look</p>
<p>at any combination of this um and in</p>
<p>this instance say this is a million doll</p>
<p>deal or opportunity what will happen</p>
<p>you'll see at the moment it's optional</p>
<p>to send it to a bid review board as soon</p>
<p>as I put the value in there it will then</p>
<p>make it compulsory so it doesn't once</p>
<p>again it doesn't dictate when the bit</p>
<p>review board will happen but what it</p>
<p>does require is that there's a bid</p>
<p>review board that's going to um look at</p>
<p>this because it is a new technology it</p>
<p>is quite a significant deal and it's a</p>
<p>new customer that we haven't dealt with</p>
<p>before so as you can see you can still</p>
<p>use business rules to set up uh the</p>
<p>guard rails for compliance to work with</p>
<p>in this some of the other things that we</p>
<p>can do at this point in time is um</p>
<p>attach</p>
<p>documentation uh we can set up questions</p>
<p>and all of this we can once again update</p>
<p>back to Salesforce in this example um if</p>
<p>you're using another CRM system uh it</p>
<p>would then write it back to the other</p>
<p>CRM system XM connect is covered in a</p>
<p>different uh video in terms of how we</p>
<p>handle integration and how we set up</p>
<p>business entities for that uh one last</p>
<p>item I'd like to cover on this before we</p>
<p>step on to the next step in this in this</p>
<p>example is process goals so because</p>
<p>because I have all these options down</p>
<p>here we need to provide people with some</p>
<p>decision support to able to make the</p>
<p>right decision around what do I want to</p>
<p>do next so some of the things if there</p>
<p>were certain other conditions here we</p>
<p>would uh remove some of the these</p>
<p>buttons dynamically and only for example</p>
<p>leave legal or credit check um but in</p>
<p>this instance uh we can once again bring</p>
<p>in information from the financial system</p>
<p>we can bring in information from the CRM</p>
<p>system and look at uh some of and and</p>
<p>put that on the dashboard uh for</p>
<p>business users to and to help them with</p>
<p>better decision support for this so in</p>
<p>this instance uh Keith uh read something</p>
<p>in the paper or he know something about</p>
<p>this organization and what i''d like to</p>
<p>do is to send it off for a credit check</p>
<p>at this point in time uh if it was a</p>
<p>different scenario or different</p>
<p>requirements he might he may have chosen</p>
<p>to send it off to a margin approval so</p>
<p>as you can see these are Dynamic so in</p>
<p>this instance the example will be that</p>
<p>he he sends it for a credit check I'm</p>
<p>just going to log in as a as uh two or</p>
<p>three steps down the process and I'm</p>
<p>going to log in as</p>
<p>Tim</p>
<p>and I'm just going to do to go to his</p>
<p>to-do list and in that to-do list under</p>
<p>market and sell product and services now</p>
<p>there's notification and escalation so</p>
<p>it'll automatically send a notification</p>
<p>to him via email or SMS um and if</p>
<p>there's no response the normal</p>
<p>escalation processes will happen but in</p>
<p>this instance uh let's look at that one</p>
<p>that came through from</p>
<p>um from Keith that was originated uh</p>
<p>from Keith so if we look at the history</p>
<p>just to see how it came to us so it was</p>
<p>initially done by Keith as you can see</p>
<p>it was a form base that he completed it</p>
<p>then um and he sent it on for a credit</p>
<p>check uh it came to John and this icon</p>
<p>here depicts that John actually uh</p>
<p>wanted to know some more information and</p>
<p>he entered into a discussion so he</p>
<p>clicked on the discussion there and if</p>
<p>we quickly look at the discussion</p>
<p>history you can see that there's some</p>
<p>unstructured discussions happening</p>
<p>inside this so um John went back to</p>
<p>Keith and say is this the same</p>
<p>opportunity as we looked at last month</p>
<p>Keith yes but it was re reissued as a</p>
<p>new project and then John sure will work</p>
<p>on this so you can see the collaboration</p>
<p>Trail is contained within the side the</p>
<p>case traal or the process Trail so this</p>
<p>is a a live order traal of the</p>
<p>information and it's not only the forms</p>
<p>based information that is captured in</p>
<p>here but also the unstructured</p>
<p>conversations that happened at there</p>
<p>you'll also see there's an un adoc task</p>
<p>or unstructured task um that um them</p>
<p>initiated now the the example of that</p>
<p>would be that looking at this there's</p>
<p>certain information and I may realize</p>
<p>that um the CRM system is not updated</p>
<p>with all the right information for</p>
<p>Express Logistics</p>
<p>so I might just send a adoc task to</p>
<p>someone and I can send a task to so I</p>
<p>can just say please review and um I'm</p>
<p>not going to go through the whole</p>
<p>example here but I can say please review</p>
<p>um um CRM</p>
<p>info for this</p>
<p>client uh and I</p>
<p>can I can upload uh attachments uh</p>
<p>screen samples I can send it on to</p>
<p>someone and I can say it needs to go to</p>
<p>Ted to do something due dates the</p>
<p>important thing is if I link it to this</p>
<p>task it will then appear inside this</p>
<p>order Trail as you saw the example if I</p>
<p>don't link it then it just puts a new</p>
<p>task on someone's to-do list and it's</p>
<p>not linked into the history as we have</p>
<p>in this example over here where you can</p>
<p>see it's actually currently linked into</p>
<p>so that gives you the ability to handle</p>
<p>events that is not even defined on here</p>
<p>but that do requ require action</p>
<p>immediate action from someone to do so</p>
<p>looking at the rest of this um screen</p>
<p>you can see we've embedded some more</p>
<p>analytics inside</p>
<p>that um looking at documents that were</p>
<p>associated now this one just has one</p>
<p>example but as you step through the</p>
<p>process and at any at any event at any</p>
<p>step in the process by any diff by any</p>
<p>specific user you can you can see all</p>
<p>the um documents that were associated to</p>
<p>this process it creates a single View</p>
<p>from a case File perspective you can</p>
<p>even preview documents in here so I can</p>
<p>look at that document and it'll download</p>
<p>it from wherever the repository in this</p>
<p>example um uh it's a SharePoint uh it</p>
<p>can be um in a exm Pro File based</p>
<p>solution or um it can be SharePoint or</p>
<p>any one of the document Management</p>
<p>Systems uh out there it's just taking a</p>
<p>few seconds to load off the server uh</p>
<p>and the cloud so there you can see</p>
<p>there's the preview of the document</p>
<p>itself once again the process goals you</p>
<p>can add additional so in the first step</p>
<p>it didn't have the actual versus budget</p>
<p>it just showed the budget and now it</p>
<p>shows actual to this manager because</p>
<p>manager's got a a slightly different</p>
<p>view on things um</p>
<p>and the last thing I'd like to cover on</p>
<p>here is the best next action now this is</p>
<p>a simple best next action um but this is</p>
<p>really trying to help them with decision</p>
<p>support once again there's a number of</p>
<p>things that need to that they have</p>
<p>options to choose from and in this</p>
<p>instance we will look at the previous</p>
<p>history under similar circumstances and</p>
<p>based on that it advises that a legal</p>
<p>review be done this these best next</p>
<p>actions there there's actually a</p>
<p>separate video on this um with a number</p>
<p>of different examples um using external</p>
<p>web services using policy guides all</p>
<p>sorts of things like that to show you</p>
<p>how um or to advise the what the best</p>
<p>next action is key thing for these kinds</p>
<p>of processes you is that you want to</p>
<p>provide decision support uh based on</p>
<p>these that is really just um an example</p>
<p>of how you would step through a a um a</p>
<p>case based or unstructured process where</p>
<p>the events in the back end are not</p>
<p>workflow into it and you can handle a</p>
<p>large number of potential events on a um</p>
<p>as the process emerges or as it steps</p>
<p>through the process I would just like to</p>
<p>make one change and show you example of</p>
<p>the dynamic capability of and I'm just</p>
<p>going to go back as</p>
<p>Keith as you'll recall on his first</p>
<p>screen I just get the password</p>
<p>right as you'll recall on the first</p>
<p>screen Keith had five different options</p>
<p>on here if I go back to to the design</p>
<p>environment in the back endend and um</p>
<p>looking at the properties of that what I</p>
<p>can do is under Dynamic</p>
<p>allocation if I for example want to be</p>
<p>able to add a finance review in there or</p>
<p>um and what I'll do is I'll just call</p>
<p>this</p>
<p>Finance</p>
<p>review I save</p>
<p>that and when I go back to the front end</p>
<p>if I reset this</p>
<p>screen you will see that Finance review</p>
<p>now appear as an option I didn't have to</p>
<p>do any manual wiring in or I didn't have</p>
<p>to draw any flow diagrams I didn't have</p>
<p>to do anything to get um that option</p>
<p>onto the screen so that's really how</p>
<p>easy it is</p>
<p>to add new activities or events on the</p>
<p>Fly thank you for watching this video</p>
<p>and uh please come back to watch some of</p>
<p>the others showing some of the other</p>
<p>functionality inside exm pro thank you</p>
<p>for your time</p>
