<p>{% embed url=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s55Dg9PcfLY&quot; %}</p>
<p>This is a short demo that shows how XMPro integrate smart devices in the &quot;Internet of Things&quot; with intelligent or smart business processes.</p>
<p>See <a href="http://xmpro.com/xmpro-iot/">http://xmpro.com/xmpro-iot/</a> for more information where you can also download a whitepaper that describes how to connect smart devices to business processes.</p>
<p>This is a lab setup and the first part of the video shows the UI on the device itself, how it logs data to a time series database and how it triggers an alert that, in turn, starts a new process in XMPro.</p>
<p>It was done to demonstrate a number of key requirements of integrating devices with processes. The first part of the video and UI is actually the on-board software on the lab device itself and show how data is logged to the cloud and how an alert is fired when a defined threshold is exceeded. It is not part of the business process management demo and is used to simulate how a machine would trigger an event and start an action in the BPM tool.</p>
<p>The second part of the video shows how an end user would be able to interact with the device as part of task or a workflow.It shows how an XMPro task is sent to a user, how they can interact with the device, how they collaborate with other users on the results that they see and how they act on, or complete tasks.</p>
<p>This is not something generally done with BPM tools, but in our view it is the critical link that is currently missing in &quot;commercial&quot; IoT solutions. It also shows how business users would collaborate and action work as a business processes</p>
<details>
<summary>Transcript</summary>this is a short presentation on how
<p>exempt broken egg business processes to</p>
<p>smart devices and the Internet of Things</p>
<p>at the end of the video there is a link</p>
<p>to a white paper where we explain the</p>
<p>architecture and move the steps that we</p>
<p>show in the demo well start off by</p>
<p>accessing the device itself through its</p>
<p>own internal software the onboard</p>
<p>software and in this instance we connect</p>
<p>to the device and it'll start reading</p>
<p>data and lock that to our X and private</p>
<p>time series data base that sits in the</p>
<p>cloud by adjusting the dials on the</p>
<p>device itself we now simulate the</p>
<p>environment and in this instance we've</p>
<p>set alert at 85 degrees the guides on</p>
<p>the left is reading temperature and once</p>
<p>it exceeds the level of 85 it actually</p>
<p>creates a new task which said a cry</p>
<p>triggers alert in the database and that</p>
<p>creates a new task inside XM pro now all</p>
<p>those data points in this instances or</p>
<p>saved every six seconds to the time</p>
<p>series data base that's set in the cloud</p>
<p>we will now access X and pro in this</p>
<p>instance Keith Miller receives an email</p>
<p>from the from the from the system with</p>
<p>alert and there's a group tour so there</p>
<p>might be multiple people doing this and</p>
<p>this instance Keith will log in you'll</p>
<p>see that it's a file out of a shutdown</p>
<p>value and it's a temperature that is</p>
<p>triggered this and by assigning this</p>
<p>task to himself it will remove it off</p>
<p>the other people who are on the service</p>
<p>team or team that can respond to this</p>
<p>this is a typical XM proform and in this</p>
<p>instance we showing the information from</p>
<p>the time series data base on the screen</p>
<p>what you'll see is that alert point is</p>
<p>the one on the right hand side that's</p>
<p>the one that triggered this specific</p>
<p>response yeah they want the spike cause</p>
<p>the task to be started informations also</p>
<p>match to the back end so the erp system</p>
<p>the asset management system so that we</p>
<p>know exactly which device we're looking</p>
<p>at nice thing is we can connect back at</p>
<p>this point in thumb onto the device so</p>
<p>we can get more information and once</p>
<p>again any changes or anything that</p>
<p>happens on the device immediately</p>
<p>available the nice thing is we can now</p>
<p>look at the temperature with some of the</p>
<p>other sensors that are on the device</p>
<p>itself next we want to control some of</p>
<p>the things on the device itself so we</p>
<p>want to switch things off we want to</p>
<p>switch things on we want to change</p>
<p>values move my for example want is to</p>
<p>set the temperature on an air</p>
<p>conditioning unit or switch or change</p>
<p>the dosage on a small dosing pump for</p>
<p>agriculture or something like that so we</p>
<p>can also access device from within XM</p>
<p>pro now when we get 2x and pro</p>
<p>functionality itself around handing</p>
<p>handling tasks there's a couple of</p>
<p>there's a couple of predefined talks but</p>
<p>I want to start an ad hoc task at this</p>
<p>point in time I want to I want them to</p>
<p>have a look at the maintenance schedules</p>
<p>that we currently have against this and</p>
<p>potentially review them or change them</p>
<p>now this is what we call an ad hoc task</p>
<p>it's not a predefined task and I can</p>
<p>link it into the order trial or history</p>
<p>or transaction history of the Sun now</p>
<p>this will put I task on Tim's to-do list</p>
<p>nexus for him to review this so it's a</p>
<p>physical task that now appears for him</p>
<p>and looking at the data that I see there</p>
<p>that spike in the graph I might even</p>
<p>want to have a discussion with one of my</p>
<p>peers with a supplier specialist or</p>
<p>someone like that and that isn't this is</p>
<p>not a task but it's a discussion so we</p>
<p>have some collaboration instead of</p>
<p>breaking out into email I actually do it</p>
<p>from within eczema and I have the full</p>
<p>so history of that so if I look at the</p>
<p>history you can see the audit trail</p>
<p>where the alert started there's an ad</p>
<p>hoc task there's a discussion and as we</p>
<p>step through this this work and we add</p>
<p>additional work items to it it will</p>
<p>build up the order trial and inside the</p>
<p>order trial I can see the discussion for</p>
<p>example next we will be able to do</p>
<p>specific tasks and those thoughts can be</p>
<p>integrated like the the work order can</p>
<p>be integrated into the ERP system or any</p>
<p>one of the other back in systems that we</p>
<p>may have this is a very quick</p>
<p>demonstration if you want more</p>
<p>information there's the white paper</p>
<p>refer to or contact us</p>
