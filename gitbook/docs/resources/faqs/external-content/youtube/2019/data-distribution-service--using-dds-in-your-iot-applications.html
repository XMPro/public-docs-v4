<p>XMPro’s integration library includes pre-built connectors for a variety of popular IoT connectivity standards like MQTT, OPC UA and DDS. In this video, we’ll demonstrate how you can use DDS in IoT applications where you need extreme reliability, scalability and low-latency connectivity.</p>
<p>We’ll use the XMPro IoT Process Designer and RTI DDS Simulator to show how you can identify exceptions in your DDS data in real-time and then automatically initiate actions. To learn more about XMPro, visit xmpro.com</p>
<p>The Data Distribution Service (DDS™) is a middleware protocol and API standard for data-centric connectivity from the Object Management Group® (OMG®). For more details on DDS visit omg.org</p>

<summary>Transcript</summary>good and welcome today we're going to go
<p>through a stream that's being configured</p>
<p>to consume data through DDS now what is</p>
<p>DDS it's the object management group or</p>
<p>oMG their data distribution service or</p>
<p>DDS standard we've logged in as a</p>
<p>particularly user interaction priority</p>
<p>and the first thing we get to is the use</p>
<p>case groups these are categories that</p>
<p>you can configure and set up that allow</p>
<p>you to group together your various use</p>
<p>cases we're going to drill into the</p>
<p>downstream so we just click into that</p>
<p>that'll take us to the various use cases</p>
<p>which have been associated to this</p>
<p>particular category we can click into</p>
<p>one and that'll take us into the actual</p>
<p>use case itself what we're looking at</p>
<p>here is a stream designer it's a</p>
<p>graphical interface that allows me to</p>
<p>drag drop and configure all the various</p>
<p>elements that I need for this particular</p>
<p>stream in this example we're consuming</p>
<p>data coming off of RTI's DDS we're</p>
<p>collecting the edge outliers that we're</p>
<p>looking for we're gonna filter those out</p>
<p>we're then going to do two things based</p>
<p>on what matches our particular filter</p>
<p>the first thing we're gonna do is we're</p>
<p>gonna send an SMS notification the</p>
<p>second thing we're gonna do is we're</p>
<p>going to push it through to a predictive</p>
<p>model we then going to gainful to those</p>
<p>results and anything that matches we're</p>
<p>going to start a maintenance or a work</p>
<p>order Spears BPM process so this is for</p>
<p>rotating equipment predictive</p>
<p>maintenance as a particularly use case</p>
<p>using the data that is going to be</p>
<p>pushed through the DDS the first thing</p>
<p>we've got is on the left you'll see your</p>
<p>various toolbox with those items the</p>
<p>first one is a listener where is our</p>
<p>information coming from so if I expand</p>
<p>that you can see there's a multitude of</p>
<p>different options that are available one</p>
<p>we're focusing on today would be the RTI</p>
<p>DDS subscriber this allows us to read</p>
<p>topic data from the RTI DDS server and</p>
<p>consume that information coming in from</p>
<p>there as well</p>
<p>the second thing that we've got is a</p>
<p>transformation so what type of</p>
<p>high-level transformation do we want to</p>
<p>do on this data and information that is</p>
<p>coming through the DD</p>
<p>the first one is we're looking for</p>
<p>outliers the second one is a filter</p>
<p>third one is a broadcast and again</p>
<p>another filter those are all types of</p>
<p>transformations that we've dragged on</p>
<p>and configured from a function</p>
<p>perspective just to highlight what we</p>
<p>have in here whether you want to bring</p>
<p>on some R scripts some FFT algorithms or</p>
<p>RCA in this example we don't have any</p>
<p>functions that we're currently using but</p>
<p>they are still available in the library</p>
<p>if you want to use them and then lastly</p>
<p>action agent what type of action do you</p>
<p>want to take with this information that</p>
<p>is actually matching the data as its</p>
<p>flown through DDS the first action that</p>
<p>we wanted to touch on was we wanted to</p>
<p>push information to an SMS we want to</p>
<p>notify soul immediately we also wanted</p>
<p>to put something on a exome Pro VPN</p>
<p>process form you could also push</p>
<p>information back as a publisher to the</p>
<p>DDS server if that is something that you</p>
<p>want to do from a use case perspective</p>
<p>if I close the tool box here so we've</p>
<p>got this running it is currently</p>
<p>published and we're consuming data</p>
<p>coming off of our TR now to that end</p>
<p>what I'm going to do is I'm going to be</p>
<p>using the RTI shapes demo just to</p>
<p>illustrate information and data flowing</p>
<p>through and the various options that you</p>
<p>have when you're actually but to</p>
<p>configure this and how do you consume</p>
<p>the data for that if I come back to the</p>
<p>stream there's a live view option so</p>
<p>we're going to click that on the right</p>
<p>what the live view does is it shows me</p>
<p>data that is flowing currently through</p>
<p>those particular points I'm interested</p>
<p>in the edge art layer so that's</p>
<p>information that's coming directly off</p>
<p>of the DDS server and I'm also</p>
<p>information looking for information that</p>
<p>comes out in the filter as well so those</p>
<p>are the outliers I'm actually looking</p>
<p>for so if I go back to the the shapes</p>
<p>demo everything that we've configured is</p>
<p>around the square so I'm gonna publish a</p>
<p>square I'm just going to keep it blue</p>
<p>and we're just gonna let that what</p>
<p>you'll see in the background is as soon</p>
<p>as I've published the square we're</p>
<p>automatically picking up the data coming</p>
<p>through the the DDS it is sending us the</p>
<p>particular edge</p>
<p>and in this instance is only looking for</p>
<p>blue as a particular colors if I go into</p>
<p>the square again and I say I'm looking</p>
<p>for another color again we'll have two</p>
<p>sets of information and if I scroll down</p>
<p>here and we go to the end you'll see the</p>
<p>two colors start coming through here as</p>
<p>well so if I go back in there the</p>
<p>squares are what we're actually looking</p>
<p>for so how is this actually configured</p>
<p>if I move out of that not close the live</p>
<p>view if you double click any of the</p>
<p>components on your what it'll do is will</p>
<p>open up this configuration pane that'll</p>
<p>allow you to configure this particular</p>
<p>stream object in this instance we're</p>
<p>configuring the RTI DDS subscriber we've</p>
<p>got a particular polling interval we've</p>
<p>got a particular domain that we're</p>
<p>looking for and if I click the drop-down</p>
<p>we're looking for the various items now</p>
<p>I have two squares published so it's</p>
<p>going to give both of those as</p>
<p>particular topics for me if I go back to</p>
<p>the RTI it's got and delete everything I</p>
<p>want one square which is gonna be blue</p>
<p>and I want one triangle and it's make it</p>
<p>orange so I've got two very different</p>
<p>shapes which are generating data for me</p>
<p>through the show to demo if I come back</p>
<p>and I just close that and I go back into</p>
<p>it again so again we're opening up the</p>
<p>configuration for the RTI stream object</p>
<p>if I go down to the topic you'll see I</p>
<p>have access to square and triangle for</p>
<p>the topics coming in here as well so</p>
<p>this is a live look up on the actual DDS</p>
<p>server as those topics are available you</p>
<p>can actually select them and make use of</p>
<p>them here as soon as you select them</p>
<p>you'll see topic properties down on the</p>
<p>bottom here so this is again made</p>
<p>available through the DDS integration</p>
<p>and says for that particular topic these</p>
<p>are the properties that are available I</p>
<p>can select all of them or I can delete a</p>
<p>few that I'm not interested in actually</p>
<p>using if I found that a particular topic</p>
<p>doesn't exist so I'm looking for circle</p>
<p>as an example I can actually create the</p>
<p>topic from within the configuration</p>
<p>window here as well</p>
<p>then I would need you to specify the</p>
<p>properties and that'll actually publish</p>
<p>that particular topic to the DDS server</p>
<p>and it'll also start listening on that</p>
<p>particular error for me as well so this</p>
<p>is how we can configure the various</p>
<p>items for the DDS that we're looking for</p>
<p>so what I'm going to take you through</p>
<p>now is what do we actually configure</p>
<p>here with this information as we made</p>
<p>available so let's go back to the live</p>
<p>view that'll bring us the blue coming</p>
<p>through so what we've configured is when</p>
<p>the Blue Square is bouncing around the</p>
<p>screen and generating the data for us</p>
<p>that's what we're seeing down the bottom</p>
<p>here come up with us what we're</p>
<p>interested is in when that actually</p>
<p>changes to yellow so I'm gonna delete</p>
<p>that and I'm only interested when the</p>
<p>square is actually coming in as yellow</p>
<p>as soon as the square comes in as yellow</p>
<p>let's see across the top there that is</p>
<p>the filter item that I'm looking for so</p>
<p>that's the one anomaly in this set of</p>
<p>information as soon as is made available</p>
<p>I won't trigger an SMS and I want to</p>
<p>trigger off for a particular work order</p>
<p>you'll still see down the bottom here</p>
<p>we're still consuming the data as it's</p>
<p>been made available but I'm interested</p>
<p>in when a change to yellow and as soon</p>
<p>as that happened I want to send out an</p>
<p>SMS and I want to start a particular</p>
<p>work order coming down the bottom here</p>
<p>again if we double click into any of</p>
<p>these you can get access to the</p>
<p>configuration which is how we are able</p>
<p>to connect to this particular DDI server</p>
<p>it also allows us to connect to a</p>
<p>particular topic and consume the</p>
<p>particular properties off of that so</p>
<p>first item from a subscriber perspective</p>
<p>or considering data from the RTR DDS</p>
<p>server we're looking for some particular</p>
<p>outliers in this instance when the</p>
<p>square was not blue but it was actually</p>
<p>yellow we're filtering that out we're</p>
<p>gonna do two things one which is to send</p>
<p>an SMS the second is to send that to a</p>
<p>predictive model filter out the results</p>
<p>from a predictive model and then we'll</p>
<p>create a particular work order inside</p>
<p>excellent performer bpm perspectives</p>
<p>you</p>
