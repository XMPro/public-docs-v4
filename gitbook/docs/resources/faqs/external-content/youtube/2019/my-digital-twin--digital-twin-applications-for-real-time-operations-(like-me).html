<summary>Transcript</summary>everyone's talking about digital twins
<p>but I find so many different definitions</p>
<p>and different understandings and I</p>
<p>thought I'd use myself as an example and</p>
<p>explain how digital twin applications</p>
<p>for real time operations can really help</p>
<p>organizations improve asset performance</p>
<p>and help find those unexpected events</p>
<p>that typically increase the risk and</p>
<p>cost us money so if you look at a</p>
<p>digital twin for myself so this is me</p>
<p>well this is a photo of me but this is</p>
<p>me and a couple of years ago at</p>
<p>Microsoft event Microsoft expire inspire</p>
<p>event they had a great set up where you</p>
<p>could stand on a rotating disc and they</p>
<p>were a couple of kinetic cameras and as</p>
<p>the disc spun it would take a 3d image</p>
<p>of you which they handed out so now I</p>
<p>have a 3d model of myself which I could</p>
<p>potentially use for a number of</p>
<p>different use cases I could I could</p>
<p>print a 3d model of myself I could</p>
<p>potentially fit some clothes on this 3d</p>
<p>model and see what brands would fit me</p>
<p>or what different colors would look like</p>
<p>but you know is this really a digital</p>
<p>twin of myself and looking at how</p>
<p>digital twins has evolved over the last</p>
<p>couple years I kind of came to the</p>
<p>conclusion that my smartphone is</p>
<p>probably a better representation of a</p>
<p>digital twin or myself then that 3d</p>
<p>model now if you look at the history of</p>
<p>digital twins it typically started off</p>
<p>as 3d or CAD based models where we try</p>
<p>to create a visual representation or</p>
<p>digital representation of a physical</p>
<p>object as as digital twins own evolving</p>
<p>we're starting to see that it's more</p>
<p>than just a 3d model but it actually</p>
<p>encapsulates a lot of the things that I</p>
<p>do it knows a lot about me in a number</p>
<p>of different areas now the smart phone</p>
<p>is a great example of this way there are</p>
<p>a number of different applications on my</p>
<p>phone that knows quite a lot about me so</p>
<p>if you look at the photos my phone knows</p>
<p>where I've been</p>
<p>what people I I've I've been in contact</p>
<p>with my families if it looks at Google</p>
<p>map data it will know where I've</p>
<p>traveled we have been like wise with</p>
<p>Instagram or Skype it'll mark</p>
<p>conversations well hopefully it doesn't</p>
<p>know all the the detail of the</p>
<p>conversation but it's a bit creepy that</p>
<p>when I when I get in my car it even</p>
<p>knows where I'm going so Google is</p>
<p>telling me you know you're heading there</p>
<p>and it'll take you this long to drive</p>
<p>there which again is a little bit creepy</p>
<p>in but in terms of predictive capability</p>
<p>of digital twins it kind of shows the</p>
<p>future of ways some of these things are</p>
<p>going and to be quite honest my phone</p>
<p>knows a lot more about me than anyone</p>
<p>else including my wife and close family</p>
<p>my my my phone knows absolutely</p>
<p>everything you know if we look at a</p>
<p>couple of examples around my my health</p>
<p>for example there are different number</p>
<p>of health apps and depending on what I'm</p>
<p>but what I want to use it for it's got</p>
<p>different sets of data that it that it</p>
<p>collects either real time or when I when</p>
<p>I'm using that specific app likewise</p>
<p>with finances it knows everything about</p>
<p>my investments my banks but my bank</p>
<p>account what I'm spending on my credit</p>
<p>card</p>
<p>the the the stocks that I'm invested in</p>
<p>and in terms of my travel where I've</p>
<p>been so in if you're looking at the</p>
<p>phone as a repository or as a single</p>
<p>front-end it's not a single database</p>
<p>with all the information in each</p>
<p>application has its own data source and</p>
<p>it can it can interchange so if you're</p>
<p>looking at the health apps it can</p>
<p>interchange some of the data so but but</p>
<p>but each app has got it its own data</p>
<p>source we its own way of collecting its</p>
<p>own analytics and it's only use guys</p>
<p>that it applies to but it's all</p>
<p>accessible from one single user</p>
<p>interface and it it's got the best</p>
<p>representation</p>
<p>of of knowing who I'm talking to</p>
<p>socially we have been what my financial</p>
<p>state is and also what my health is so</p>
<p>if I look at health in a little bit more</p>
<p>detail if you go into for example the</p>
<p>Apple health app it'll show you in terms</p>
<p>of your current performance in terms of</p>
<p>where you're in terms of activity and</p>
<p>things that you might have done it will</p>
<p>show you some of your records now some</p>
<p>of these are historical records anything</p>
<p>from and again this is whether it can</p>
<p>come from a sensor it could come from</p>
<p>doctors records there could be different</p>
<p>places where all this data comes from</p>
<p>but this is the single place where I can</p>
<p>see and this is the best digital</p>
<p>representation of myself it knows more</p>
<p>about my health than anyone else in one</p>
<p>single area so whether it is it is heart</p>
<p>health health records reproductive</p>
<p>health there's a broad range of of</p>
<p>different data sources and depending</p>
<p>again on the use case that I'm that I</p>
<p>want to use this health data for so in</p>
<p>my instance I'm a aspiring triathlete so</p>
<p>for example if I use Strava and one of</p>
<p>the things that I do I'd like to try and</p>
<p>based on on keeping my heart right at a</p>
<p>certain level</p>
<p>so that's real-time monitoring and</p>
<p>information that I'm that I need to know</p>
<p>and what does digital twin does he shows</p>
<p>me where I've been it gives me some of</p>
<p>the historical data for a specific</p>
<p>activity so I can look into that but I</p>
<p>can also see that real-time and you know</p>
<p>I can even have it on on a different</p>
<p>user interface like Apple watch where I</p>
<p>can actually see it real-time as I'm</p>
<p>doing the exercise and the other use</p>
<p>case for the same information is that my</p>
<p>family so when I'm at a race my family</p>
<p>can monitor me in real-time without</p>
<p>looking at the physical me if I just</p>
<p>look at</p>
<p>my twin or proxy on the internet so they</p>
<p>don't have to look at me they just look</p>
<p>at this there's avatar that I have on on</p>
<p>on the Internet and it uses the same</p>
<p>sensors that that feed the different you</p>
<p>eyes through the same IP eyes so each</p>
<p>app doesn't have to have its own sensor</p>
<p>data my phone for example the GPS is</p>
<p>used by multiple different applications</p>
<p>for their own use but it's the same GPS</p>
<p>location the same with any one of the</p>
<p>other sensors in the phone the other</p>
<p>interesting thing with this is I can</p>
<p>swap out equipment the underlying sense</p>
<p>the equipment so I can change my Fitbit</p>
<p>to a Garmin or have a new model of a</p>
<p>Garmin or whatever new and lightest fad</p>
<p>there is worth with the sensor based</p>
<p>technology that I use to collect this</p>
<p>data and it doesn't even blip on the app</p>
<p>the app doesn't even know because it's</p>
<p>just collecting the data through a</p>
<p>standard integration user interface and</p>
<p>if I swap out the underlying data source</p>
<p>the application and what I use this for</p>
<p>in this example my heart rate training</p>
<p>it does not even know that I've swapped</p>
<p>out the underlying equipment so looking</p>
<p>at this this is the best representation</p>
<p>of me if you wanted to know if from a</p>
<p>digital twin perspective again it knows</p>
<p>everything about me in terms of my</p>
<p>physical health financial health</p>
<p>my social life who I know what</p>
<p>conversations I'm I mean who I'm</p>
<p>connected to so this is the best digital</p>
<p>representation of myself and if we look</p>
<p>at our factory or plant or mine so how's</p>
<p>this different than just having my my</p>
<p>iPhone or my Android or whatever device</p>
<p>you're using as the as the the place</p>
<p>that serves all the applications well it</p>
<p>isn't really different so if</p>
<p>look at how we see it from my XM Pro</p>
<p>perspective we have all these different</p>
<p>apps so whether this is my Google Maps</p>
<p>or Skype or Outlook or whatever it is</p>
<p>that I'm that I'm using all my health</p>
<p>apps so let's say for example the</p>
<p>equipment maintenance that you see there</p>
<p>similar to do what you saw on the health</p>
<p>app if I go one level deeper into</p>
<p>equipment maintenance I can see the</p>
<p>different applications that I can that I</p>
<p>can set up as digital twin</p>
<p>representations so for example I can</p>
<p>create a centrifugal pump condition</p>
<p>monitoring or predictive maintenance</p>
<p>model the first is I two different</p>
<p>applications and they use the same</p>
<p>underlying data source and the way that</p>
<p>we set this up inside XM Pro is here's</p>
<p>my data flow or how I wire up my digital</p>
<p>twin from different data sources so in</p>
<p>this instance it's using OSI soft and</p>
<p>OPC UA and it's going through some logic</p>
<p>some analytics the same as what my phone</p>
<p>is doing when it's predicting where I'm</p>
<p>heading if you look at what Google Maps</p>
<p>are doing or what my time is going to be</p>
<p>if I run or and in this instance we're</p>
<p>predicting a certain equipments going to</p>
<p>file and then we are creating work</p>
<p>orders and sending our recommendation</p>
<p>and putting it on a dashboard for you to</p>
<p>see the interesting thing is I can swap</p>
<p>out OPC or or the OSI data source with a</p>
<p>different data source and it wouldn't</p>
<p>change what I'm seeing at the end what</p>
<p>might digital twin representation is the</p>
<p>thing that I'm getting at the end now</p>
<p>what this could look like again this</p>
<p>could be a dashboard similar to what</p>
<p>you've seen on this driver 1 + X employ</p>
<p>dashboards can have some historical data</p>
<p>some real-time status what is happening</p>
<p>right now coming from that data stream</p>
<p>the historical two ones could be looking</p>
<p>at at historical records similar to what</p>
<p>you've seen on the health app some</p>
<p>recommendations around what I should be</p>
<p>doing</p>
<p>and then current open tasks so looking</p>
<p>at this hydrocracking unit the digital</p>
<p>twin for this hydrocracking unit is</p>
<p>telling me quite a lot of information</p>
<p>around that so I don't have to go out to</p>
<p>the to the physical unit I can just look</p>
<p>at this if I look at a maintenance a</p>
<p>pump where a certain condition occurred</p>
<p>down that flow again a different style</p>
<p>of dashboard so every app can have its</p>
<p>own look and feel in terms of what the</p>
<p>dashboards look like inside exemplar but</p>
<p>I can see also other information coming</p>
<p>from my si B or Maximo or whatever</p>
<p>EAM system what current maintenance</p>
<p>we've got planned what did we do</p>
<p>recently so bringing in some of that</p>
<p>transactional information again like the</p>
<p>health records and we're not replacing</p>
<p>it so this is not one mega uber big</p>
<p>digital twin it actually connects to the</p>
<p>data that sits in the different places</p>
<p>it's not replacing it it's also not</p>
<p>replicating it it is merely showing it</p>
<p>you in the context of the application</p>
<p>that you're trying to use it in in this</p>
<p>instance I want to either on the right</p>
<p>hand side and select a certain action</p>
<p>whether it's grading work orders</p>
<p>requesting space escalating into</p>
<p>engineering to have a look at this and</p>
<p>review it all the different use cases</p>
<p>and yes I can have the 3d models</p>
<p>embedded as part of that as part of this</p>
<p>decision support in this digital twin so</p>
<p>as you can see there's no difference</p>
<p>between how I use my smart phone as my</p>
<p>digital twin representation there is no</p>
<p>difference in terms of how you can set</p>
<p>up digital twin applications for</p>
<p>real-time operations monitoring and</p>
<p>operations management</p>
<p>now just to explain a little bit in</p>
<p>terms of at what level does a digital</p>
<p>twin sit well it can actually sit at any</p>
<p>level it really depends on what your use</p>
<p>case is so it might be that I've got</p>
<p>that I specifically want to look at this</p>
<p>gear box on the Bommel and that might be</p>
<p>a simple twin so I've got a simple</p>
<p>dashboard simple monitoring</p>
<p>or it might be a composite twin which is</p>
<p>assembly of a number of different</p>
<p>individual twin components and this</p>
<p>creates my ball more unit so this is for</p>
<p>one ball more all my use case might be I</p>
<p>need to look at the total throughput</p>
<p>throughput in my whole processing plant</p>
<p>and for that this ball mill is just one</p>
<p>of the components so again this digital</p>
<p>twin can fit into a broader or bigger</p>
<p>application which we call kind of a</p>
<p>system based composite and digital twin</p>
<p>and then just in terms of the proxy as I</p>
<p>said when I was running the rice my</p>
<p>family didn't have to look at me</p>
<p>physically they could look at my proxy</p>
<p>which is really that digital twin and I</p>
<p>could see where I am and what my</p>
<p>performance is life without a digital</p>
<p>twin if for all the different use cases</p>
<p>that you have operations maintenance</p>
<p>safety and like a whole number of</p>
<p>different ones quite often you end up</p>
<p>having different or senses that</p>
<p>duplicate or replicate the same</p>
<p>information and every kind of use case</p>
<p>has got its own sensors on operations</p>
<p>have their own sensors and information</p>
<p>that they're collecting and it creates</p>
<p>these silos of different information the</p>
<p>benefit is if you're using this digital</p>
<p>twin approach now I just think of myself</p>
<p>with my phone in the middle and the</p>
<p>different use cases that I have like</p>
<p>health finance and whatever the case</p>
<p>might be where the phone rate with all</p>
<p>these little blocks represent the</p>
<p>different applications on my phone</p>
<p>likewise on a plant if I've got a well</p>
<p>platform and I use the concept of a</p>
<p>digital twin which can contain physics</p>
<p>based models analytics models so the</p>
<p>physics based models classically where a</p>
<p>lot of these things thought it with</p>
<p>finite element methods and some of the</p>
<p>engineering things like thermodynamics</p>
<p>analytical model some of the newer</p>
<p>things that we're seeing around</p>
<p>predictive capability all the time</p>
<p>series data and historical data that we</p>
<p>are collecting around time time values</p>
<p>and then is a transactional data sitting</p>
<p>in your piece around maintenance master</p>
<p>data around what is the equipment when</p>
<p>did we buy it and visual models like</p>
<p>like the CAD and 3d and and some of the</p>
<p>others so as you can see there is no</p>
<p>difference between myself and my iPhone</p>
<p>versus your plant and its digital twin</p>
<p>and it's in different use cases</p>
