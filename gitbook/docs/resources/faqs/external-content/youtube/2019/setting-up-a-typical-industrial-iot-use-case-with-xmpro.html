<p>See how to set up a use case using XMPro's Agile Application Suite for Industrial IoT.</p>
<p>The video uses the example of continuously monitoring thousands of solar panels in the desert to predict which are dirty or broken. It also shows how to easily connect to third-party applications like SAP EAM or OSIsoft. To learn more visit <a href="http://xmpro.com">http://xmpro.com</a></p>

<summary>Transcript</summary>the use case manager in our exemplar
<p>agile design suite allows you to</p>
<p>visually orchestrate IOT data sources</p>
<p>services and applications to grade</p>
<p>multiple different IOT applications in</p>
<p>this example we will look at a solo form</p>
<p>a thousands of solar panels each</p>
<p>generating IOT data that we may want to</p>
<p>use to create work orders inside sa baam</p>
<p>for example for those solar panels that</p>
<p>are likely to be dirty and which we</p>
<p>would like to be cleaned by a field</p>
<p>services team we will start by dragging</p>
<p>active listeners onto the canvas</p>
<p>now extemporize active listeners is an</p>
<p>extensible library of predefined</p>
<p>streaming connectors to connect to a</p>
<p>vast array of IOT data sources we also</p>
<p>have transformations to manipulate and</p>
<p>manage the data and provide analytical</p>
<p>capability on the canvas context</p>
<p>providers are used in richly information</p>
<p>and finally we have action agents to</p>
<p>trigger actions inside s ap or other</p>
<p>third-party applications and can also</p>
<p>create tasks inside the XM pro console</p>
<p>in this example we'll be bringing data</p>
<p>in from OSI soft as a time series</p>
<p>database we will drill into that in a</p>
<p>little bit more detail later but we</p>
<p>combine this with weather data from a</p>
<p>REST API some MQTT data coming off the</p>
<p>sensors on the panels itself and combine</p>
<p>that data contextualize it with si Pei M</p>
<p>information to know which make and model</p>
<p>it is and finally we will run it through</p>
<p>a Hana model to predict the dirty panels</p>
<p>for those panels that are likely to be</p>
<p>dirty we're bringing in additional</p>
<p>information from ASAP ERP and we show</p>
<p>that on analytical dashboard inside s IP</p>
<p>Hana the most important step though is</p>
<p>to create a work order inside ASAP EAM</p>
<p>finally we would also like to do a root</p>
<p>cause analysis or a failure mode inside</p>
<p>and start that inside XM pro each stream</p>
<p>object have a property pane so let's</p>
<p>look at the OSI soft property pane and</p>
<p>in here we can see how we set up the</p>
<p>data connection to is always a softer</p>
<p>read the data from a specific PI server</p>
<p>in the same way we can also set up the</p>
<p>properties for in</p>
<p>tt in this example and in this instance</p>
<p>it is a push so it means it's a</p>
<p>real-time data feed from the sensor data</p>
<p>we combine all of this data through a</p>
<p>join transformation and in this join</p>
<p>transformation it shows up all the</p>
<p>properties from all the various data</p>
<p>sources what we want to do is create I</p>
<p>join based on the customer number so as</p>
<p>you'll see right at the bottom here we</p>
<p>combining all the different data sources</p>
<p>for a specific timestamp and connect</p>
<p>them via the customer number the next</p>
<p>one we will look at from a property</p>
<p>perspective is the ERP information so if</p>
<p>we look at the information coming out of</p>
<p>from the ERP side you can see it is a</p>
<p>get action to read information from the</p>
<p>casts that which is specific to the</p>
<p>customer next what we want to do is kick</p>
<p>off an action to create a work order</p>
<p>inside a CPE I am in this instance it's</p>
<p>a put action so we push the data through</p>
<p>and if you double click on the arrow you</p>
<p>can actually set up the mapping of the</p>
<p>data sources on the left hand side the</p>
<p>data is coming out of the event stream</p>
<p>and on the right hand side the fields</p>
<p>are available from s IP to map this to</p>
<p>this is a visual mapping making it very</p>
<p>easy to take data from the event streams</p>
<p>and push it to the right place into the</p>
<p>work order I'd also like to create a</p>
<p>task inside the X and proc action</p>
<p>console to do a root cause analysis and</p>
<p>for that we also want to identify which</p>
<p>task it is and how we want to kick off</p>
<p>the action again mapping the data to the</p>
<p>form you'll see the data appear on the</p>
<p>form itself the data that you see over</p>
<p>here will be on the XM platform we've</p>
<p>now set up an event stream inside</p>
<p>ex-emperor IRT application suite what</p>
<p>I'd like to show you next is what this</p>
<p>data looks like inside sa Pei M and also</p>
<p>on the X and production console let's</p>
<p>look at the work order created in ASAP</p>
<p>eim in this ASAP instance I know the</p>
<p>transaction code that I'm looking for</p>
<p>and I also know that we've created a</p>
<p>service order for this specific example</p>
<p>around this</p>
<p>the panel's so I will interrogate and</p>
<p>return all the open service orders for</p>
<p>this example I'll also look for the ones</p>
<p>that are created or generated through XM</p>
<p>Pro integration in the event stream and</p>
<p>here's an example of one of those as you</p>
<p>can see in the header the order was</p>
<p>created from inside X and prevent stream</p>
<p>in ants also assigned to the right</p>
<p>responsible party as well as the</p>
<p>operations and cost centers using X and</p>
<p>Prez visual designer project can now</p>
<p>ensure that you have the right</p>
<p>integration with the right information</p>
<p>income coming from the right sensor at</p>
<p>real time without any manual</p>
<p>interventions and this is all done</p>
<p>through X and price event streams now</p>
<p>let's look at this in the ex-emperor</p>
<p>action console we can display data from</p>
<p>census as well as SFA eim and ERP into</p>
<p>the dashboard but what we're really</p>
<p>interested in is the task list for the</p>
<p>root cause analysis that was initiated</p>
<p>by this event stream information for</p>
<p>this can come from ASAP as well as the</p>
<p>PI system and we can also get readings</p>
<p>off the live since the streams to</p>
<p>display to the engineers for decision</p>
<p>support I can also show infrared images</p>
<p>from a drone for the panel for example</p>
<p>and all of this is part of the decision</p>
<p>support that we trying to create for the</p>
<p>engineers you can create customized</p>
<p>forms as part of all of these actions</p>
<p>you may have some special instructions</p>
<p>that you want to do before you create a</p>
<p>work order inside si p4 from this user</p>
<p>interface for those who go out and do</p>
<p>something around this specific panel see</p>
<p>I am work orders can also come from this</p>
<p>user interface not only the event</p>
<p>streams you can also collaborate inside</p>
<p>X impress so I could talk to other</p>
<p>engineers and other users of the system</p>
<p>to find out if they've had similar</p>
<p>experiences around panels in in their</p>
<p>area with sensors I can also create an</p>
<p>addict task if say a specific action</p>
<p>that I that I want or predefined action</p>
<p>is not there so I can go and set up an</p>
<p>adduct task for someone to go and do</p>
<p>something similarly you can create case</p>
<p>files that contains information like</p>
<p>reports photographs and</p>
<p>artifacts that you may want to keep for</p>
<p>a specific incident here we provide</p>
<p>contextual information coming out of CAD</p>
<p>systems and other business systems for</p>
<p>decision support in order to drive the</p>
<p>next steps of what we want someone to do</p>
<p>in this example we've taken data from</p>
<p>IOT systems created an event stream and</p>
<p>created actions inside of a CPI M and</p>
<p>other business systems</p>
