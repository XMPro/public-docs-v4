<p>In this video, you'll learn what a Rapid Application Builder for Industrial IoT is and why it matters to companies in industries like manufacturing, mining, oil and gas and utilities. You'll also see an example of how you can build an IoT application with XMPro to prevent events like fin fan failure in your industrial plant.</p>
<details>
<summary>Transcript</summary>in this presentation I'll quickly run
<p>you through what a rapid industrial I at</p>
<p>the application Boulder is an approach</p>
<p>around this is how can you very quickly</p>
<p>build out in a lean way a Minimum Viable</p>
<p>Product where you can test hypotheses</p>
<p>because quite often we find this IOT</p>
<p>things is quite new for a lot of</p>
<p>organizations they don't really know how</p>
<p>to start that I know where the ROI is</p>
<p>going to be and really it's a discovery</p>
<p>kind of process so using a lean approach</p>
<p>where you start off with a Minimum</p>
<p>Viable Product and what do we need to</p>
<p>build out what hypothesis do we need to</p>
<p>test how do we check that the data comes</p>
<p>through this can be done in X and</p>
<p>probably a very very quick and easy</p>
<p>visual way and once you've found those</p>
<p>use cases where there is ROI and there's</p>
<p>a meaningful business case you can then</p>
<p>look at how do i scale this out to the</p>
<p>enterprise and all of this is just so</p>
<p>that we can realize quick time to value</p>
<p>and then spend time and resources and</p>
<p>money on on things that don't work well</p>
<p>so when you look at X and prototypical</p>
<p>we call the mega use cases or big</p>
<p>buckets of problems that we solve what a</p>
<p>lot of organizations are currently</p>
<p>looking at how can we become smart at</p>
<p>our operations and things like</p>
<p>maintenance it's quite at the forefront</p>
<p>but it's just one typical use case that</p>
<p>sits inside this predictive operations</p>
<p>operational intelligence how do I make</p>
<p>sure I'm not blindsided I know I have</p>
<p>this real-time situational awareness in</p>
<p>terms of operational excellence again</p>
<p>safety quality asset integrity key big</p>
<p>buckets of problems that many of the</p>
<p>customers are looking to address</p>
<p>likewise with operational risk how can</p>
<p>we look at it from a loss prevention and</p>
<p>tracking how do we make sure that we</p>
<p>know where risk events are and how we</p>
<p>can potentially mitigate them how can we</p>
<p>run a digital business where we do</p>
<p>digital transformation how can we</p>
<p>integrate different operations and have</p>
<p>that visibility across them</p>
<p>and one of the one of the key things</p>
<p>that we got out quite often find us how</p>
<p>can we respond to events quickly how can</p>
<p>we reduce the latency between when</p>
<p>events happen and when we take action</p>
<p>and quite often that relates back to</p>
<p>things like process health where what is</p>
<p>the overall status of the different</p>
<p>areas of my business process and so that</p>
<p>I have that awareness so that I can</p>
<p>respond quickly to two things that might</p>
<p>impact my business and lastly one of the</p>
<p>key things around running businesses</p>
<p>these days is making sure that you have</p>
<p>customers that you have a good custom</p>
<p>and employee experience and again</p>
<p>real-time responsiveness is becoming</p>
<p>more and more a key part of that</p>
<p>and so looking at Exim Pro what is it</p>
<p>well it's essentially a model driven</p>
<p>application builder by model driven we</p>
<p>mean we can drag and drop blocks on you</p>
<p>and in a visual way we can construct</p>
<p>what the problem is</p>
<p>what it does it's essentially the</p>
<p>software glue that connects real-time</p>
<p>data sources to analytics whether it's</p>
<p>simple analytics or complex analytics</p>
<p>and then what we really want these</p>
<p>actions that come out of the business so</p>
<p>how do we connect this to actions like</p>
<p>work orders or any other business</p>
<p>processes or even workflows that might</p>
<p>be customized and what it means for</p>
<p>organizations that that that leverage</p>
<p>this capability is that their subject</p>
<p>matter experts like the engineers</p>
<p>technicians and architects can create</p>
<p>and deploy in a very agile a way as I</p>
<p>mentioned earlier from a lean approach</p>
<p>perspective in an agile way and in an</p>
<p>iterative way real-time IOT applications</p>
<p>that can serve a range of different use</p>
<p>cases so it's not just a single problem</p>
<p>that you can solve but you can use this</p>
<p>approach and reuse the blocks on here to</p>
<p>address multiple challenges inside them</p>
<p>inside the business and the whole</p>
<p>objective is to do this with as little</p>
<p>coding as possible and most of it in the</p>
<p>usual in the visual user interface that</p>
<p>you see</p>
<p>so what does ex-emperor consist of there</p>
<p>are two main components we talk about</p>
<p>the agile design studio and this is</p>
<p>typically where we design applications</p>
<p>and components for that and I'll take</p>
<p>you show you an example of that and then</p>
<p>how do we plot deploy this in the action</p>
<p>console where we take action the best</p>
<p>way to show you what that is and how it</p>
<p>works is actually to do a quick</p>
<p>demonstration in the demonstration are</p>
<p>we talking about fan fans and a fan fan</p>
<p>you can see the flatbed truck this is</p>
<p>typically the units that fit on top of a</p>
<p>cooling tower in an industrial plant</p>
<p>typically typically used in mining oil</p>
<p>and gas and energy and utilities and</p>
<p>broad range of those industries and</p>
<p>again if you look at the impact of this</p>
<p>if one of those fan fans file you have</p>
<p>to shut down the whole cooling tower</p>
<p>operation which in in in again quite</p>
<p>often impacts the operations and</p>
<p>sometimes you have to even shut down</p>
<p>your whole operations plant some</p>
<p>customers run hundreds some literally</p>
<p>run thousands of these inside the</p>
<p>organization and if if the bearings wear</p>
<p>out and we have misalignment on any of</p>
<p>these shafts here the vibration on these</p>
<p>fans will shake the whole building</p>
<p>depart so let me quickly show you how we</p>
<p>address this kind of problem inside</p>
<p>ex-emperor so this is a typical user</p>
<p>interface for an engineer this is called</p>
<p>the ex-emperor use case manager and inia</p>
<p>I can see multiple different use cases</p>
<p>or problems that I'm trying to solve</p>
<p>inside the business so it might be</p>
<p>anything from monitoring power and</p>
<p>variable speed motors it could be the</p>
<p>fan fans which we will discuss in this</p>
<p>example it could be vibration analysis</p>
<p>logistics deviation failure of</p>
<p>deliveries but access monitoring and up</p>
<p>and but mining bearing failure so as you</p>
<p>can see as an engineer I can address</p>
<p>multiple different</p>
<p>business problems in the in the use case</p>
<p>manager so with the fan fans those</p>
<p>massive big fan fans on the top of the</p>
<p>cooling tower we will start off with a</p>
<p>very basic model and quite often we find</p>
<p>this is our customers go through the</p>
<p>process as they as they get more</p>
<p>sophisticated as they get more data and</p>
<p>as they understand the problem that</p>
<p>they're trying to solve them much better</p>
<p>that will go through a more going from a</p>
<p>basic model like we have here to more</p>
<p>advanced which I will also show in this</p>
<p>example so before I go into the backend</p>
<p>and how a lot of this constructed let me</p>
<p>quickly run you through the logic of</p>
<p>what we seen here so we're going to get</p>
<p>a vibration and temperature which is</p>
<p>currently stored in our in a historian</p>
<p>system in this instance always icesoft</p>
<p>so the vibration and the temperature on</p>
<p>the on the shaft and bearing that all</p>
<p>that fan fan in place and from the ERM</p>
<p>system in the process it management or</p>
<p>the as an intelligence network or</p>
<p>depending on on which system you use to</p>
<p>store the mic and model for example</p>
<p>we'll get some information some</p>
<p>contextual information around the fan</p>
<p>fan in this instance we want to know</p>
<p>which make and model it is so we can</p>
<p>pass that together by combining it with</p>
<p>to a machine learning model that will</p>
<p>give us a prediction whether this</p>
<p>machine this fan fan is likely to fail</p>
<p>if it is likely to fail we will just</p>
<p>very simply create a work order so a</p>
<p>very simple model again we take</p>
<p>vibration and temperature data we</p>
<p>combine that with model and make and</p>
<p>model information run a machine learning</p>
<p>model get a prediction if this is going</p>
<p>to fail and if it's going to fail</p>
<p>creative work order inside the eim</p>
<p>system now the way that we bring</p>
<p>information in or we have a concept of</p>
<p>extensible library so this this means we</p>
<p>can extend the library</p>
<p>you can extend the library or your</p>
<p>systems integrator for example could</p>
<p>extend the library of what we call</p>
<p>listeners or data sources where we can</p>
<p>bring data from this is a small subset</p>
<p>of available listeners transformations</p>
<p>how can we change the information like</p>
<p>you can see we can combine the</p>
<p>information contextualized those are</p>
<p>typically transformations and that we</p>
<p>can do it can even run scripts there to</p>
<p>do very specific data cleanup if the</p>
<p>missing value substituted for example</p>
<p>doesn't address your specific</p>
<p>requirement bringing in context as I</p>
<p>mentioned previously we wanted to bring</p>
<p>in the Mikan model from a certain for</p>
<p>certain piece of equipment again</p>
<p>extensible library concept so very easy</p>
<p>for us to add additional library</p>
<p>components and we can add it you can add</p>
<p>it and your systems integrator can also</p>
<p>add it action agents this is what at the</p>
<p>india what do we want it to do so action</p>
<p>agents again broad range of action</p>
<p>agents built on the exact same</p>
<p>extensible library construct so that you</p>
<p>can add new specific applications that</p>
<p>you may have in your business where you</p>
<p>want to send the data to and then lastly</p>
<p>statistical and other mathematical</p>
<p>functions for example doing forcefully</p>
<p>transformations running or scripts from</p>
<p>an analytics perspective if you have</p>
<p>your own algorithms all of these are</p>
<p>available as drag and drop items once</p>
<p>I've dragged the item on I can configure</p>
<p>the properties so what you'll see in</p>
<p>this instance with this RSI example this</p>
<p>is the RSI server setup so and this</p>
<p>looks actually looks at the asset</p>
<p>framework structure that is inside I was</p>
<p>also so it will expose all the</p>
<p>properties and values of the underlying</p>
<p>services that have connect what we're</p>
<p>doing here is we we because it's not a</p>
<p>real-time streaming data source which we</p>
<p>will California by having a channel to</p>
<p>push it to well you have to pull the</p>
<p>date that we did every 10 seconds</p>
<p>and we do it based on the specific asset</p>
<p>framework we'll be looking for the</p>
<p>information so very easy for an engineer</p>
<p>or a subject matter expert to construct</p>
<p>these once the the blocks are deployed</p>
<p>and this is typically done within the IT</p>
<p>organization to ensure governance access</p>
<p>controls and security everything that we</p>
<p>need around IT governance and once it is</p>
<p>available and published it then becomes</p>
<p>object that the engineer someone like</p>
<p>that can drag on let's step onto a</p>
<p>little bit more of a sophisticated</p>
<p>example of this our fan fans are very</p>
<p>very basic very simple but you can see</p>
<p>how we can monitor real-time for certain</p>
<p>conditions I'm going to jump right to</p>
<p>the extended model I'm skipping the one</p>
<p>in the middle and in this extended model</p>
<p>it is essentially exactly the same</p>
<p>process we are reading data evaporation</p>
<p>and temperature from here we're bringing</p>
<p>an information make and model from the</p>
<p>manufacturer here we run that exact same</p>
<p>predictive model to see if it's likely</p>
<p>to fail if it is likely to fail we want</p>
<p>to take certain actions so I want to</p>
<p>publish to a dashboard</p>
<p>I want to send out a SMS and we want to</p>
<p>in the XM Pro action management side of</p>
<p>things want to create failure mode</p>
<p>analysis root cause analysis push it</p>
<p>with visualization dashboards what we</p>
<p>also do with the same data so by</p>
<p>broadcasting the data over here and</p>
<p>broadcasting it over here we can now</p>
<p>call a second predictive model now that</p>
<p>we know it is likely to file we can call</p>
<p>a second predictive model which will</p>
<p>dictate will will give us a remaining</p>
<p>useful life so say for example in this</p>
<p>instance we get a remaining useful life</p>
<p>of a hundred hours it means we have a</p>
<p>window of opportunity to maintain that</p>
<p>piece of equipment within a hundred</p>
<p>hours the challenge with that is way in</p>
<p>the hundred hours is the best time to do</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>and with XM Pro as you can see you can</p>
<p>join multiple algorithms and logical</p>
<p>components</p>
<p>and analytics together so by joining is</p>
<p>a first predictive model a second</p>
<p>predictive model and a third</p>
<p>optimization model with this one we'll</p>
<p>look at production schedules customer</p>
<p>orders at maintenance work orders and</p>
<p>find the best slot to do the maintenance</p>
<p>so for example if this was a hundred</p>
<p>hours we have a window of remaining</p>
<p>useful life we may find the most optimum</p>
<p>slot to do any maintenance is 62 hours</p>
<p>and we would then also go and look</p>
<p>inside the EAM system against that</p>
<p>specific equipment identifying critical</p>
<p>space and see if that if those spares</p>
<p>are available if it is we will then go</p>
<p>and check if there is a work order if</p>
<p>there is currently a work order we'll</p>
<p>check whether it's at the 62 hour point</p>
<p>if not we can create the work order</p>
<p>there or we can put it in the task list</p>
<p>of the work of the maintenance planner</p>
<p>to create the work order inside the 62</p>
<p>hour time frame if there's no work order</p>
<p>then we create it so as you can see the</p>
<p>same approach but in this instance a</p>
<p>little bit more expansive in terms of</p>
<p>being able to create work orders based</p>
<p>on three predictive models one is it</p>
<p>going to file yes what's remaining is</p>
<p>4life hundred hours what's the best</p>
<p>maintenance lot 62 hours do we have</p>
<p>space and through this whole process</p>
<p>we've collected all the data that we</p>
<p>need to create a really smart and</p>
<p>intelligent work orders again the same</p>
<p>logic applies for creating actions so if</p>
<p>I create a work order for example in</p>
<p>here this is the the back end to do that</p>
<p>and if I want to map the data by</p>
<p>clicking on the on the arrow I can now</p>
<p>map as you can see I can map my my data</p>
<p>fields coming in to what the integration</p>
<p>component expects on the other side the</p>
<p>last thing that I want to do and show</p>
<p>you in years now that we have this</p>
<p>running so now that we've set this up</p>
<p>can run this model and this is a key</p>
<p>element of XM products not just to have</p>
<p>a visual model but how do you execute</p>
<p>the model how do you now run it and push</p>
<p>the data through and in this example</p>
<p>what you'll see is it starts the</p>
<p>different services and if the service</p>
<p>starts successfully it will turn green</p>
<p>if there's a challenge or a problem with</p>
<p>any of the services don't start up or</p>
<p>doesn't function properly and the blocks</p>
<p>will turn red instead of the instead of</p>
<p>the green that you see here and that'll</p>
<p>give you what the current health the</p>
<p>status is what you see now is a system</p>
<p>where it actually pumps the data through</p>
<p>so it reads the information from all of</p>
<p>this combines the information and run</p>
<p>the predictive models and create the</p>
<p>work orders on the on the back inside so</p>
<p>let me stop this and again it's now</p>
<p>stops all the underlying services this</p>
<p>could be deployed in a hybrid</p>
<p>environment so this could be run on</p>
<p>premise this core part could be run on</p>
<p>the cloud and this part could be run</p>
<p>back on premise it's a key deployment</p>
<p>benefit of using X and Pro is that not</p>
<p>all your data needs to reside on premise</p>
<p>not all your data needs to reside in a</p>
<p>cloud you can construct these so that</p>
<p>the pubsub model the publication of this</p>
<p>one we are publishing with in the end</p>
<p>where this one subscribe is dictated by</p>
<p>the ex-emperor orchestration engine very</p>
<p>powerful approach and feature so with</p>
<p>that it concludes the the overview of</p>
<p>how X and Pro you can set up real-time</p>
<p>data listening capability and how it can</p>
<p>create actions based on the analytics</p>
<p>that you apply to it</p>
