<summary>Transcript</summary>hi my name is Kirsten Schwarzer and
<p>welcome to this ex and pro learning</p>
<p>series on UX design for real-time apps</p>
<p>in this series I'm going to show you a</p>
<p>repeatable process that you can use to</p>
<p>build applications that not only look</p>
<p>good but that also solve real problems</p>
<p>before you jump into the X and Pro app</p>
<p>designer it's important to think deeply</p>
<p>about the problem that you're trying to</p>
<p>solve in our experience thinking through</p>
<p>the problem now will help you spend less</p>
<p>time staring at a blank screen in the</p>
<p>app designer and you'll end up with a</p>
<p>much better result if you're still</p>
<p>deciding which problem to work on we</p>
<p>recommend using the X and Pro use case</p>
<p>prioritization matrix to help you rank</p>
<p>your problems based on their business</p>
<p>impact and their technical feasibility</p>
<p>if you aren't familiar with this matrix</p>
<p>please reach out to our team at support</p>
<p>at X and procom for more details in this</p>
<p>example we're trying to reduce unplanned</p>
<p>downtime of boiler feed pumps in a</p>
<p>thermal power plant we've determined</p>
<p>that this problem has a high impact on</p>
<p>our business and that it's technically</p>
<p>feasible to build a real-time condition</p>
<p>monitoring app with the data that we</p>
<p>have available when we think about this</p>
<p>problem there are five things that we</p>
<p>need to consider firstly what critical</p>
<p>real-time events do you need to know</p>
<p>about when it comes to this problem so</p>
<p>if we want to prevent downtime on our</p>
<p>boiler feed pumps the critical real-time</p>
<p>events that we should know about or</p>
<p>things like spikes in temperature or</p>
<p>vibration going above a certain</p>
<p>threshold next what decisions does the</p>
<p>person using this app need to make to</p>
<p>respond to that event do they need to</p>
<p>decide whether a certain temperature</p>
<p>spike means we need to perform immediate</p>
<p>maintenance on this pump what are the</p>
<p>decisions that they need to make thirdly</p>
<p>what data would the user need to see to</p>
<p>make an informed decision in this</p>
<p>example you want real-time sensor data</p>
<p>from the pump but you might also want to</p>
<p>see the list of scheduled work orders or</p>
<p>the work order</p>
<p>history next is there anything</p>
<p>preventing the user from making a</p>
<p>decision or taking an action</p>
<p>do they need input from someone else or</p>
<p>is there data locked up in a certain</p>
<p>system that they need to get access to</p>
<p>is there a calculation that needs to be</p>
<p>done to figure out what the right action</p>
<p>is or does a machine learning algorithm</p>
<p>need to make a prediction lastly what</p>
<p>key metrics are you trying to improve</p>
<p>this will help you understand why this</p>
<p>is an important problem to solve and</p>
<p>what the potential ROI will be we're</p>
<p>sort of trying to break things down into</p>
<p>first principles and really understand</p>
<p>the problem there's a great Elan musk</p>
<p>quote that says with first principles</p>
<p>you boil things down to the most</p>
<p>fundamental truths and then you reason</p>
<p>up from there in our case we're trying</p>
<p>to break the problem down into the most</p>
<p>fundamental truths and then design our</p>
<p>application from there to make things</p>
<p>easy for you we've created a PowerPoint</p>
<p>template that you can use to answer each</p>
<p>of these questions in a way that's easy</p>
<p>to present and that summarizes your</p>
<p>thinking on one slide you can download</p>
<p>the template by going to the link in the</p>
<p>description below this video</p>
