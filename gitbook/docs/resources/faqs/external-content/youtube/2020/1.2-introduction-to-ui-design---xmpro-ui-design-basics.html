<summary>Transcript</summary>in the previous video you heard me use
<p>the terms</p>
<p>ux and ui design you're probably</p>
<p>wondering what these terms</p>
<p>mean and how they're different from each</p>
<p>other</p>
<p>according to usertesting.com user</p>
<p>experience design is the process of</p>
<p>designing products that are useful</p>
<p>easy to use and delightful to interact</p>
<p>with</p>
<p>you can think of this as the umbrella</p>
<p>term for what we're doing when we design</p>
<p>interfaces ux design includes things</p>
<p>like user research</p>
<p>creating personas doing usability</p>
<p>testing</p>
<p>creating user stories designing user</p>
<p>flows</p>
<p>and designing the user interface</p>
<p>so user interface or ui design</p>
<p>is purely focused on the visual design</p>
<p>of the interface for an</p>
<p>app or a website it involves choosing</p>
<p>colors</p>
<p>fonts and styling interactive elements</p>
<p>like icons and buttons</p>
<p>now that you understand what it means</p>
<p>when i refer to ui or ux design</p>
<p>i'm going to go through a few key design</p>
<p>principles that you should keep in mind</p>
<p>as we move through this course</p>
<p>the five foundational principles of ui</p>
<p>design that i want to go through with</p>
<p>you</p>
<p>are clarity flexibility familiarity</p>
<p>efficiency and consistency</p>
<p>i understand that these words might not</p>
<p>mean much to you at the moment</p>
<p>but i'm going to take you through a few</p>
<p>practical examples</p>
<p>to show you how they apply to your</p>
<p>designs</p>
<p>clarity so clarity means your designs</p>
<p>should be simple</p>
<p>and easy to understand there's a common</p>
<p>saying</p>
<p>that a confused mind says no and when</p>
<p>someone is confused by your interface</p>
<p>they're very likely to stop using it you</p>
<p>want to avoid using</p>
<p>elements that don't have a clear meaning</p>
<p>in your interface</p>
<p>when you create an interface the user</p>
<p>should always know</p>
<p>three basic things firstly they should</p>
<p>know where they are</p>
<p>then they should know what they need to</p>
<p>do and</p>
<p>finally they should know what's going to</p>
<p>happen next like when they click on a</p>
<p>button</p>
<p>or drill down into something they should</p>
<p>know what to expect</p>
<p>and that is how you bring clarity into</p>
<p>your user interface design</p>
<p>now let's look at some examples</p>
<p>you'll see that the modal on the left</p>
<p>has dozens of check boxes that are</p>
<p>aligned in all sorts of different ways</p>
<p>there's no clear hierarchy to indicate</p>
<p>what the most important action is</p>
<p>there are 12 buttons in that one modal</p>
<p>and they all look equally important</p>
<p>this is definitely going to leave a user</p>
<p>feeling confused about what to do</p>
<p>and about what's going to happen next</p>
<p>now compare that to the modal on the</p>
<p>right</p>
<p>this is a good example of clarity in ui</p>
<p>design</p>
<p>it comes from envision which is an</p>
<p>interactive prototyping software</p>
<p>platform</p>
<p>that we use here at xm pro we use it to</p>
<p>prototype products like our app designer</p>
<p>and the data stream designer</p>
<p>you'll see that this modal has a very</p>
<p>clear hierarchy in terms of text</p>
<p>you can tell by the heading that this</p>
<p>modal is all about deleting your</p>
<p>prototype</p>
<p>there's a warning that tells you if you</p>
<p>do this you can't</p>
<p>undo it it also shows you all the things</p>
<p>that are going to happen</p>
<p>once you click the button and they make</p>
<p>the default choice prominent</p>
<p>so you're clear which one is actually</p>
<p>going to delete your prototype</p>
<p>now let's look at flexibility</p>
<p>in the 1990s the fathers of user</p>
<p>experience</p>
<p>design jacob nielsen and ralph muller</p>
<p>came up with something called heuristic</p>
<p>evaluation</p>
<p>which is a way to do usability</p>
<p>evaluations</p>
<p>they then turned those heuristics into</p>
<p>10 rules</p>
<p>their rule around flexibility says that</p>
<p>every system</p>
<p>has two types of users you have beginner</p>
<p>users</p>
<p>and power users and your system should</p>
<p>be created</p>
<p>to empower both of those</p>
<p>one way that you can build flexibility</p>
<p>into your interfaces</p>
<p>is by adding shortcuts while that's not</p>
<p>necessarily</p>
<p>directly applicable to the apps you'll</p>
<p>create in the xm pro app designer</p>
<p>it's useful to get you thinking about</p>
<p>how you can cater for users with</p>
<p>different skill levels</p>
<p>you could create an easily accessible</p>
<p>icon that</p>
<p>power users can click on to navigate</p>
<p>directly</p>
<p>or provide tooltips for beginners these</p>
<p>simple tweaks can go a long way to</p>
<p>accommodating both types of users</p>
<p>in your interface</p>
<p>the third principle we're going to look</p>
<p>at is familiarity</p>
<p>i want to stress you do not have to</p>
<p>reinvent the wheel with your user</p>
<p>interface design</p>
<p>using familiarity means that you're</p>
<p>going to use</p>
<p>elements that users are used to seeing</p>
<p>in interfaces</p>
<p>one example is using a house icon to</p>
<p>show them how to get back to the home</p>
<p>page</p>
<p>using familiar elements in your</p>
<p>interface is one way to reduce the</p>
<p>learning curve for your app</p>
<p>and also improve the speed at which</p>
<p>people use it</p>
<p>one way to add familiarity is by using</p>
<p>commonly accepted terms</p>
<p>things like home search cart delete</p>
<p>and cancel words like main</p>
<p>find or remove have a similar meaning in</p>
<p>the literal sense</p>
<p>but they're just not commonly used in</p>
<p>interfaces and those</p>
<p>uncommon terms might add confusion to</p>
<p>the user experience</p>
<p>efficiency refers to how long it takes</p>
<p>an expert user</p>
<p>to complete a task in your app you</p>
<p>should always be asking yourself</p>
<p>whether there's a more efficient way to</p>
<p>do something in your app</p>
<p>but you have to also be careful to not</p>
<p>reduce the steps so much</p>
<p>that you start negatively impacting the</p>
<p>user experience</p>
<p>especially for those beginner users that</p>
<p>we talked about in the flexibility</p>
<p>section</p>
<p>these efficiency examples are a bit</p>
<p>small</p>
<p>but they do demonstrate what a big</p>
<p>impact a small change can have</p>
<p>so on the left you can customize your</p>
<p>email preferences for an email</p>
<p>newsletter</p>
<p>by choosing whether you want to receive</p>
<p>emails immediately</p>
<p>daily or not at all and when the user</p>
<p>clicks on one of these radio buttons</p>
<p>they turn blue</p>
<p>but there's no save button it turns out</p>
<p>that the system</p>
<p>automatically saves your choice but</p>
<p>there's no indication to the user that</p>
<p>anything actually happened</p>
<p>and this might be confusing to them so</p>
<p>if you look at the example on the right</p>
<p>you'll notice a very subtle difference</p>
<p>there's a green tick icon with the word</p>
<p>saved</p>
<p>by adding that simple element you've</p>
<p>given the user an indication</p>
<p>that their action worked the main thing</p>
<p>to take away from this example</p>
<p>is that the screen on the left tried to</p>
<p>be too efficient</p>
<p>and ended up negatively impacting the</p>
<p>user experience</p>
<p>by adding a small indicator like that</p>
<p>saved message on the right</p>
<p>the designer could create a much more</p>
<p>pleasant experience</p>
<p>that was still efficient for the user</p>
<p>the last principle we'll cover in this</p>
<p>lesson is consistency</p>
<p>you want to create consistency in the</p>
<p>look and feel of your app</p>
<p>but also in how the user interacts with</p>
<p>it</p>
<p>elements should mean the same thing</p>
<p>every time the user sees them in your</p>
<p>interface</p>
<p>it's important to keep in mind that</p>
<p>different words symbols</p>
<p>and even colors have meanings that</p>
<p>people associate with them</p>
<p>and it's important to use them</p>
<p>consistently across your interface</p>
<p>in the example on the left you'll see</p>
<p>that there's not a lot of consistency</p>
<p>being used in this interface</p>
<p>the fonts colors and sizes are</p>
<p>completely different</p>
<p>it's difficult to make sense of what's</p>
<p>going on even the main menu</p>
<p>is in the middle of the page and on the</p>
<p>right</p>
<p>we have a great example of consistency</p>
<p>this is zapier.com's app store</p>
<p>they've created a format that they use</p>
<p>for each of the apps they have an</p>
<p>integration for</p>
<p>you'll notice that each app follows the</p>
<p>exact same pattern</p>
<p>it has an icon a heading and a</p>
<p>description</p>
<p>in this example the user will know</p>
<p>exactly where they are</p>
<p>what's going to happen next and what</p>
<p>they're supposed to do</p>
<p>so let's recap the principles of ui</p>
<p>design that you need to keep in mind</p>
<p>as you create your app interfaces</p>
<p>your designs should have clarity and the</p>
<p>user should always know</p>
<p>where they are what to do and what to</p>
<p>expect</p>
<p>you need to be flexible to allow power</p>
<p>users and beginners</p>
<p>to easily use your interface use</p>
<p>elements that are familiar to your users</p>
<p>to help speed up their learning curve</p>
<p>and get their work done make your design</p>
<p>efficient so that there are no</p>
<p>unnecessary steps</p>
<p>but be careful of making it so efficient</p>
<p>that you negatively impact the user</p>
<p>experience</p>
<p>use consistency and the look and feel</p>
<p>and how your user interacts with the app</p>
<p>it's worth considering what meaning</p>
<p>certain icons words and colors have</p>
<p>before adding them to your interface</p>
