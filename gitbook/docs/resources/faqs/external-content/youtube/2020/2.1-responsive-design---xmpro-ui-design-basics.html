<summary>Transcript</summary>in this lesson we'll be looking at
<p>responsive design</p>
<p>how many devices do you currently have</p>
<p>in your household</p>
<p>you probably have a mobile phone or a</p>
<p>tablet a laptop</p>
<p>or a desktop that you use to interact</p>
<p>with the digital world and my guess is</p>
<p>that you have more than one device</p>
<p>the user interfaces you create need to</p>
<p>work</p>
<p>on a variety of different devices</p>
<p>browsers</p>
<p>and screen sizes have you ever tried to</p>
<p>use your phone to navigate a website</p>
<p>that wasn't</p>
<p>optimized for mobile it can be a really</p>
<p>frustrating experience</p>
<p>some of the text might be cut off it's</p>
<p>difficult to navigate</p>
<p>and even if you turn your device</p>
<p>sideways it still might not work</p>
<p>properly</p>
<p>that's why responsive design is such an</p>
<p>important element in user interface</p>
<p>design</p>
<p>so what exactly is responsive design</p>
<p>well according to the nielsen norman</p>
<p>group</p>
<p>responsive design is a development</p>
<p>approach that creates</p>
<p>dynamic changes to the appearance of a</p>
<p>website or application</p>
<p>depending on the screen size and</p>
<p>orientation of the device being used to</p>
<p>view it</p>
<p>that was a mouthful in short it means</p>
<p>your interface layout adapts to the</p>
<p>screen</p>
<p>that it's being viewed on since</p>
<p>responsive design has become a</p>
<p>fundamental part of creating any user</p>
<p>interface</p>
<p>there are multiple schools of thought on</p>
<p>the best approach to take</p>
<p>should you design the mobile version</p>
<p>first or the desktop version</p>
<p>the answer is that it depends it depends</p>
<p>on which device your users are most</p>
<p>likely to use</p>
<p>most often because what looks great on</p>
<p>one screen</p>
<p>might look too sparse or too dense on</p>
<p>another</p>
<p>it's important to consider the</p>
<p>information density appropriate for each</p>
<p>device</p>
<p>so if you scale up a mobile version of</p>
<p>the site to</p>
<p>a big desktop screen there might not be</p>
<p>enough information</p>
<p>for it to actually have a good user</p>
<p>experience</p>
<p>and if you design something mainly for a</p>
<p>desktop and you try and scale it down</p>
<p>onto mobile</p>
<p>and you keep all of the information</p>
<p>visible it can be too cluttered and</p>
<p>difficult to work with</p>
<p>information density is a really</p>
<p>important thing to consider</p>
<p>and i'll show you some examples in the</p>
<p>following slides it basically refers to</p>
<p>the amount of information that you put</p>
<p>in the given space</p>
<p>so when you use high information density</p>
<p>if you look at the new york times</p>
<p>example we have here</p>
<p>there's a lot of information that they</p>
<p>want to show their users</p>
<p>they need to show headlines for news</p>
<p>articles excerpts to get people</p>
<p>interested in reading the full piece</p>
<p>photos updates on the s p dao and nasdaq</p>
<p>markets</p>
<p>the weather new podcasts and the</p>
<p>navigation menu</p>
<p>there's a lot going on on the screen but</p>
<p>if you view it on a desktop</p>
<p>it works you have enough space on the</p>
<p>screen to see all the information</p>
<p>comfortably</p>
<p>and still make sense of it all according</p>
<p>to material.io</p>
<p>google's helpful resource for user</p>
<p>interface designers</p>
<p>when a user views and interacts with</p>
<p>large amounts of information</p>
<p>high density components can create a</p>
<p>good experience for them</p>
<p>and i think this new times home page is</p>
<p>a great example of that</p>
<p>things like lists grids and long forms</p>
<p>are also examples of high density</p>
<p>components</p>
<p>and when you're using high density</p>
<p>components it's very important to create</p>
<p>scannable groups of content</p>
<p>you can do this by using larger margins</p>
<p>and padding between</p>
<p>components so that there's enough space</p>
<p>for your eye to separate the elements</p>
<p>now what about mobile well the smaller a</p>
<p>user's screen</p>
<p>the more information they will need to</p>
<p>keep in their memory</p>
<p>as they interact with your interface</p>
<p>it's good practice to reduce the</p>
<p>information</p>
<p>density on mobile enough to help the</p>
<p>user</p>
<p>easily consume and navigate through it</p>
<p>remove</p>
<p>any non-critical information that might</p>
<p>detract from the mobile experience</p>
<p>another key consideration for mobile is</p>
<p>making your buttons and text links</p>
<p>large enough to tap with your finger</p>
<p>without touching other elements on the</p>
<p>screen</p>
<p>so once you've designed an interface in</p>
<p>the xm pro app designer</p>
<p>it's important to test it on different</p>
<p>browsers and devices</p>
<p>to check that all of the components</p>
<p>display as you expected</p>
<p>so in this photo you'll see an example</p>
<p>of me testing the new xmpro.com website</p>
<p>i used all of the devices in my</p>
<p>household to see how the website worked</p>
<p>on various screen sizes but if you don't</p>
<p>have access to multiple devices</p>
<p>you can simulate them using device mode</p>
<p>in chrome dev tools</p>
<p>i've shared the link in the description</p>
<p>below this video</p>
<p>it's important to design your apps with</p>
<p>mobile and desktop interfaces in mind</p>
<p>this means that you'll need to create a</p>
<p>responsive design</p>
<p>that adapts based on the screen size of</p>
<p>the device it's being viewed on</p>
<p>and when you do this you need to</p>
<p>consider information density</p>
<p>and test your interface across various</p>
<p>devices and browsers</p>
<p>to ensure that it's compatible in the</p>
<p>next video we're going to cover</p>
<p>how to use responsive grids in your</p>
<p>layout</p>
