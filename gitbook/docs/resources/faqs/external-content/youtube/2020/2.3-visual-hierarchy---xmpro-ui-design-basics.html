<summary>Transcript</summary>it's important to create
<p>visual hierarchy in your designs to help</p>
<p>your users</p>
<p>understand what's most important nobody</p>
<p>likes to interact with a monotonous wall</p>
<p>of text on a screen</p>
<p>with ui design it's important not to</p>
<p>miss the forest for the trees</p>
<p>it's so easy to get bogged down in</p>
<p>choosing colors and font sizes</p>
<p>and to forget that there are really</p>
<p>important questions that you actually</p>
<p>need to ask</p>
<p>to ensure that your interface serves the</p>
<p>people that it's meant for</p>
<p>here are a few questions to ask yourself</p>
<p>when creating a visual hierarchy</p>
<p>firstly what is the story that your page</p>
<p>needs to tell</p>
<p>are you designing an app to help detect</p>
<p>equipment failure for something like</p>
<p>slurry pumps</p>
<p>then your page needs to tell the story</p>
<p>of the pump's real-time health</p>
<p>next you should ask what does the user</p>
<p>need to know first</p>
<p>if you're designing a screen for pump</p>
<p>health the user might want to see a</p>
<p>health score</p>
<p>which is an easy metric for them to</p>
<p>gauge the pump's current condition</p>
<p>then you should ask yourself which</p>
<p>elements will give the user a general</p>
<p>overview</p>
<p>and which are more detailed the user</p>
<p>might also want to see the work order</p>
<p>history for the pump</p>
<p>but that can be lowered down on the page</p>
<p>let's take a look at this design on the</p>
<p>right for rocket invoicing</p>
<p>you'll see that they have cards with key</p>
<p>metrics at the top of the screen</p>
<p>it's important to organize elements from</p>
<p>most important to least</p>
<p>important when you're designing an</p>
<p>interface</p>
<p>overview elements like health scores and</p>
<p>kpis</p>
<p>should generally be placed above the</p>
<p>fold</p>
<p>above the fold is an old term that comes</p>
<p>from the newspaper world</p>
<p>and describes printing something above</p>
<p>where the newspaper was folded</p>
<p>when designing for digital applications</p>
<p>this generally means</p>
<p>before the user needs to scroll now</p>
<p>depending on your geography</p>
<p>users read from either left to right or</p>
<p>right to left</p>
<p>and it's important to understand this</p>
<p>when designing your interface</p>
<p>if your users read from left to right</p>
<p>you want to put the most important</p>
<p>information in the top left of the</p>
<p>screen since that's what they're going</p>
<p>to read first</p>
<p>now let's look at how to reinforce</p>
<p>visual hierarchy in your designs</p>
<p>first we're going to look at contrast</p>
<p>then repetition</p>
<p>then alignment and then proximity or</p>
<p>crap</p>
<p>for short the mobile app design on the</p>
<p>right</p>
<p>is a great example of how you can use</p>
<p>contrast</p>
<p>to direct the user's eye to what is most</p>
<p>important</p>
<p>there are various ways to add contrast</p>
<p>to a design</p>
<p>in this example the designer used color</p>
<p>to make</p>
<p>elements that are important stand out</p>
<p>you can also add contrast to the size of</p>
<p>an element</p>
<p>using outlines fills or different font</p>
<p>families and weights</p>
<p>one way to see whether you have enough</p>
<p>contrast in your interface</p>
<p>is to do the squint test if you squint</p>
<p>and try and look at the design</p>
<p>you'll see that something clearly stands</p>
<p>out and that's the orange button that</p>
<p>says subscribe now</p>
<p>while this test is quite a rudimentary</p>
<p>way of evaluating your interface</p>
<p>it will help you get an idea of whether</p>
<p>there's enough contrast for the</p>
<p>important elements to truly stand out</p>
<p>now let's look at repetition why would</p>
<p>you want to use repetition in an</p>
<p>interface</p>
<p>well it helps the user know what to</p>
<p>expect it also creates consistency</p>
<p>and it groups related elements together</p>
<p>because they're styled in a similar way</p>
<p>the online learning platform design on</p>
<p>the right is a great example</p>
<p>of how you can use repetition to create</p>
<p>an</p>
<p>interface that is really well organized</p>
<p>and easy to use</p>
<p>next we're going to cover vertical and</p>
<p>horizontal alignment</p>
<p>in your interfaces so a common mistake</p>
<p>that i see</p>
<p>untrained designers make is more often</p>
<p>than not</p>
<p>center aligning text many people think</p>
<p>this creates</p>
<p>balance because there's equal space to</p>
<p>the left and to the right of text</p>
<p>but if you consider that most users</p>
<p>either read from left to right</p>
<p>or right to left aligning your text to</p>
<p>the left or right</p>
<p>is probably a more practical way of</p>
<p>doing things</p>
<p>so let's look at vertical alignment</p>
<p>you'll see that there are some bright</p>
<p>teal lines that i've added to the design</p>
<p>on the right</p>
<p>the words light startup growth and mega</p>
<p>are all aligned</p>
<p>at the bottom of the text or what is</p>
<p>called the baseline</p>
<p>the paragraphs just under those titles</p>
<p>which say</p>
<p>for those just starting out and best for</p>
<p>growing businesses</p>
<p>those are aligned at the top or what is</p>
<p>called the ascender</p>
<p>you'll also see that the cards align at</p>
<p>the top</p>
<p>and at the bottom and they're all</p>
<p>exactly the same height</p>
<p>this is called vertical alignment it's</p>
<p>when the center</p>
<p>top or bottom of the elements align on</p>
<p>an invisible</p>
<p>horizontal line if the elements happen</p>
<p>to be different sizes</p>
<p>you'll need to decide how to best align</p>
<p>them vertically</p>
<p>now let's look at horizontal alignment</p>
<p>this is when the center</p>
<p>left or right side of an element aligns</p>
<p>on an invisible vertical line in most</p>
<p>cases you'll use</p>
<p>left align for text if your user reads</p>
<p>from left</p>
<p>to right let's discuss proximity</p>
<p>so when you group elements closely</p>
<p>together they visually tell the user</p>
<p>that they're related in the examples on</p>
<p>the right</p>
<p>the teal circles form one group and next</p>
<p>to them we have the same number of</p>
<p>circles</p>
<p>but these are blue and there's a gap</p>
<p>between two groups of blue circles</p>
<p>this just demonstrates how your eye</p>
<p>groups elements together based on their</p>
<p>proximity</p>
<p>and how effectively grouping elements</p>
<p>can help a user understand</p>
<p>and navigate information faster</p>
<p>now it's time to get your pen and papers</p>
<p>ready because in the next video</p>
<p>we're going to start drawing wireframes</p>
