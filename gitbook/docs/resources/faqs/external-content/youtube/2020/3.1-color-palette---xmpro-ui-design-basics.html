<summary>Transcript</summary>i want to bust some myths about creating
<p>color palettes</p>
<p>you might think that you need to have an</p>
<p>artistic flair or an eye for design to</p>
<p>create a good color palette but that's</p>
<p>not true</p>
<p>there are very specific rules and</p>
<p>guidelines that you can learn to help</p>
<p>you create</p>
<p>great color palettes every time even if</p>
<p>you don't consider yourself an autistic</p>
<p>person</p>
<p>you might have noticed a change in</p>
<p>interface design over the last year or</p>
<p>two</p>
<p>many applications now come with a dark</p>
<p>and a light theme so which one's better</p>
<p>at the moment even the experts disagree</p>
<p>so according to nielsen norman</p>
<p>for users with normal vision light mode</p>
<p>actually leads to better performance</p>
<p>most of the time</p>
<p>but when we look at google's material</p>
<p>guidelines</p>
<p>they say that dark themes help to</p>
<p>improve visual ergonomics</p>
<p>by reducing eye strain adjusting</p>
<p>brightness to current lighting</p>
<p>conditions</p>
<p>and facilitating screen use in dark</p>
<p>environments</p>
<p>dark themes also tend to conserve</p>
<p>battery power because devices with oled</p>
<p>screens</p>
<p>can turn off black pixels on the right</p>
<p>you'll see an example of both light</p>
<p>and dark themes for the xmpro mobile app</p>
<p>so how do you actually create a color</p>
<p>palette</p>
<p>i'm going to take you through two</p>
<p>examples one for a light theme</p>
<p>and one for a dark theme first you want</p>
<p>to start off with a primary color</p>
<p>this color can be your brand color or</p>
<p>any particular color that you would like</p>
<p>to include across the interface</p>
<p>one way that you can use this color is</p>
<p>to include it as an accent</p>
<p>to emphasize elements like buttons and</p>
<p>links</p>
<p>now let's look at semantic colors these</p>
<p>colors are used to show</p>
<p>warnings errors success messages and</p>
<p>more information</p>
<p>typically you have green red yellow and</p>
<p>blue</p>
<p>but this can be anything you want just</p>
<p>remember that green</p>
<p>is typically associated with success red</p>
<p>with an</p>
<p>arrow yellow with a warning and blue</p>
<p>with more information</p>
<p>but this can really vary based on your</p>
<p>preferences</p>
<p>then we have neutrals i recommend having</p>
<p>at least</p>
<p>three options to work with for</p>
<p>backgrounds borders and text</p>
<p>finally we have data visualization</p>
<p>colors these represent data in various</p>
<p>formats</p>
<p>we've actually done an entire video</p>
<p>dedicated to just this topic coming up</p>
<p>in the next module</p>
<p>what you'll notice here is that the</p>
<p>colors we've chosen are what is called</p>
<p>visually equidistant from one another</p>
<p>this means</p>
<p>that they are easy for you to</p>
<p>distinguish between the various colors</p>
<p>another thing to note is that the colors</p>
<p>for the light palette can actually be</p>
<p>quite saturated</p>
<p>there aren't a whole lot of constraints</p>
<p>around saturation</p>
<p>on a light theme but that's very</p>
<p>different when you create a dark theme</p>
<p>now let's take a look at a dark color</p>
<p>palette</p>
<p>similar to the light theme you'll choose</p>
<p>a primary color</p>
<p>semantic colors neutrals and data</p>
<p>visualization colors</p>
<p>and as i mentioned if i flick between</p>
<p>the light and dark palettes</p>
<p>you'll see that the dark palette is a</p>
<p>lot less saturated</p>
<p>according to google's material</p>
<p>guidelines using</p>
<p>highly saturated colors on a dark</p>
<p>background can actually create</p>
<p>optical vibrations that make it</p>
<p>difficult for users to read</p>
<p>one important thing that i haven't</p>
<p>mentioned yet is that it's really</p>
<p>important</p>
<p>to consider accessibility when choosing</p>
<p>a color palette</p>
<p>a good ui design is accessible to as</p>
<p>many people as possible</p>
<p>and this includes low vision users</p>
<p>one way to help improve readability for</p>
<p>users with vision restrictions</p>
<p>is to use a contrast ratio as</p>
<p>recommended by the web content</p>
<p>accessibility guidelines</p>
<p>so in this example on the right you'll</p>
<p>see the top card is much harder to read</p>
<p>than the one beneath it</p>
<p>the typeface font size and font color</p>
<p>are exactly the same</p>
<p>the only difference is the contrast</p>
<p>between the background and foreground</p>
<p>colors</p>
<p>so what are the contrast ratio</p>
<p>guidelines</p>
<p>while for normal text which is around 18</p>
<p>pixels in size</p>
<p>the guidelines recommend a contrast</p>
<p>ratio of at least 4.5 to 1.</p>
<p>for larger graphics and other interface</p>
<p>components like icons</p>
<p>you need a contrast ratio of at least</p>
<p>three to one</p>
<p>this is especially important for dark</p>
<p>themes</p>
<p>now let's look at how we can improve</p>
<p>usability</p>
<p>for color blind users</p>
<p>an important thing to do is to not rely</p>
<p>on color alone when showing important</p>
<p>messages like alerts or warnings</p>
<p>it's best practice to combine the use of</p>
<p>a color with an</p>
<p>icon as you can see in the mailchimp</p>
<p>example on the top right of the screen</p>
<p>where possible avoid using either red</p>
<p>green or blue purple color combinations</p>
<p>this is quite difficult when you want to</p>
<p>show green messages for success and read</p>
<p>for warnings</p>
<p>but if you do decide to use those colors</p>
<p>it is important to add</p>
<p>icons to those messages to help</p>
<p>colorblind users understand what they</p>
<p>mean</p>
<p>another way that you can help these</p>
<p>users with data visualizations</p>
<p>is to use patterns and textures in your</p>
<p>charts versus just</p>
<p>solid colors this will help them</p>
<p>differentiate the various series in your</p>
<p>data</p>
<p>now let's take a look at what charts</p>
<p>look like to colorblind users</p>
<p>there are many types of color blindness</p>
<p>and this is just one example</p>
<p>but as you can see the blue and purple</p>
<p>become pretty much the same color in the</p>
<p>color blind version on the right</p>
<p>this was actually done using a color</p>
<p>blindness simulator that i've shared in</p>
<p>the resources below</p>
<p>and i'll take you through in a second</p>
<p>before we look at all the helpful color</p>
<p>padded resources i've gathered for you</p>
<p>there are a few important considerations</p>
<p>when it comes to creating</p>
<p>dark uis firstly you want to use a dark</p>
<p>gray</p>
<p>rather than black as the primary</p>
<p>background color for your dark ui</p>
<p>the background should also be dark</p>
<p>enough to display white text</p>
<p>which means that it needs a good enough</p>
<p>contrast ratio</p>
<p>ideally 4.5 to 1. you also need to add</p>
<p>ample white space or negative space in</p>
<p>this case</p>
<p>between elements to give the design some</p>
<p>breathing room</p>
<p>and as i mentioned earlier you want to</p>
<p>avoid using highly saturated colors</p>
<p>because they can cause optical</p>
<p>vibrations and you need to be careful of</p>
<p>over using your accent colors on a dark</p>
<p>theme</p>
<p>now let's look at a few tools that you</p>
<p>can use to help you generate color</p>
<p>palettes</p>
<p>even if you're not a designer the first</p>
<p>one is called</p>
<p>palex it's an automatic ui color palette</p>
<p>generator</p>
<p>and what's great about this is you can</p>
<p>add a base color</p>
<p>so let's say we have teal as our base</p>
<p>color</p>
<p>we can update it and it'll give us a</p>
<p>full spectrum color palette with various</p>
<p>shades</p>
<p>this gives you a whole lot of options to</p>
<p>work with</p>
<p>the next tool is called eva deep</p>
<p>learning color generator</p>
<p>so let's say i choose the same teal as</p>
<p>my primary color</p>
<p>this will give me semantic colors based</p>
<p>on the primary color that i used</p>
<p>i can even choose between a light or a</p>
<p>dark theme</p>
<p>this is a really great free tool if</p>
<p>you're looking for semantic colors that</p>
<p>fit your primary color</p>
<p>then we have the material design color</p>
<p>tool from google</p>
<p>let's use that same teal again and then</p>
<p>choose a secondary color</p>
<p>google will generate light and dark</p>
<p>shades for each of them</p>
<p>you can also export your palette and see</p>
<p>whether the colors adhere to</p>
<p>accessibility standards</p>
<p>then we have the color blindness</p>
<p>simulator that i mentioned before</p>
<p>so if you don't have a color vision</p>
<p>deficiency it can be very difficult to</p>
<p>imagine what it's like for someone who</p>
<p>does</p>
<p>what you can do here is take a</p>
<p>screenshot of your color palette</p>
<p>and upload it to this area over here you</p>
<p>can then choose from different types of</p>
<p>color deficiencies</p>
<p>and this will show you whether it's</p>
<p>still accessible for users</p>
<p>then we have a handy tool called the</p>
<p>color contrast checker</p>
<p>at adasitecompliance.com you enter a</p>
<p>color into the foreground</p>
<p>and another into the background and it</p>
<p>will show you whether this actually</p>
<p>passes the 4.5 to 1 or 3 to 1</p>
<p>recommendation ratios</p>
<p>so what do you do when the colors you</p>
<p>have don't actually meet the</p>
<p>requirements</p>
<p>well then you can use this last two on</p>
<p>the list which is called the accessible</p>
<p>color generator by learn ui.design</p>
<p>enter the closest variation of the color</p>
<p>you want to use</p>
<p>and the color you want it to contrast</p>
<p>against this will give you a compliant</p>
<p>color combination</p>
<p>by generating the closest variation to</p>
<p>the colors that you've given</p>
<p>now in the next video i'm going to teach</p>
<p>you the basics of typography</p>
