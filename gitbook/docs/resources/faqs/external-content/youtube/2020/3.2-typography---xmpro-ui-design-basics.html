<summary>Transcript</summary>in this lesson we're going to look at
<p>how to style text or</p>
<p>typography in your user interfaces</p>
<p>the first thing you need to know when it</p>
<p>comes to styling typography for your</p>
<p>interface</p>
<p>is that you need a typographic scale a</p>
<p>typographic scale</p>
<p>is classically known as a harmonious</p>
<p>progression of font sizes</p>
<p>but it's almost like the notes on a</p>
<p>musical scale</p>
<p>this will help you to create a visual</p>
<p>hierarchy and consistency in your design</p>
<p>so there are multiple ways to create a</p>
<p>typographic scale</p>
<p>the way that i like to do it is based on</p>
<p>a font measurement called</p>
<p>an m let's say that we've chosen 16</p>
<p>pixels as our base size</p>
<p>this is going to be 1m 2m</p>
<p>will then be 32 pixels in this scenario</p>
<p>so in the graphic on the right you'll</p>
<p>see that we're using a typographic scale</p>
<p>of 1.25 so 16 pixels is going to be the</p>
<p>body text size</p>
<p>then the smallest heading is going to be</p>
<p>16 pixels</p>
<p>times 1.25 in this case</p>
<p>that's going to be 20 pixels</p>
<p>the second heading size is then going to</p>
<p>be 20 pixels</p>
<p>times 1.25 which in this case is going</p>
<p>to be</p>
<p>25 pixels so you keep going up and down</p>
<p>the scale to give you enough font sizes</p>
<p>to choose from</p>
<p>but why not just choose font sizes based</p>
<p>on what you think will work</p>
<p>well the main reason to use a</p>
<p>typographic scale is that it creates</p>
<p>consistency between different heading</p>
<p>sizes</p>
<p>now if you're looking to create a</p>
<p>typographic scale for your ui i</p>
<p>advise using a table like this one on</p>
<p>the slide</p>
<p>on the left you add the name of the</p>
<p>specific element that you want to add to</p>
<p>your scale</p>
<p>i typically do it smallest at the bottom</p>
<p>to largest at the top</p>
<p>the second column has the size in pixels</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>in m's and the third column has the font</p>
<p>weight</p>
<p>since some of the items in your</p>
<p>typographic scale might be bold</p>
<p>especially headings</p>
<p>then i also like to add a column for</p>
<p>usage where i write down</p>
<p>where this particular item is going to</p>
<p>be used in the interface</p>
<p>there's a great free tool to help you</p>
<p>create your own typographic scale</p>
<p>it's called type scale and all you have</p>
<p>to do to get started</p>
<p>is enter in a base size in pixels</p>
<p>usually we're going to choose 16 pixels</p>
<p>next you're going to select the scale</p>
<p>this will then determine how big the</p>
<p>contrast is between the elements</p>
<p>so you'll see that we have a golden</p>
<p>ratio</p>
<p>perfect fifth minor third etc there's a</p>
<p>whole bunch of different options for you</p>
<p>to choose from</p>
<p>now you'll see if i choose golden ratio</p>
<p>there's going to be quite a big</p>
<p>difference between elements in this</p>
<p>typographic scale</p>
<p>i prefer the major third scale because</p>
<p>it gives enough differentiation between</p>
<p>elements</p>
<p>but without becoming too big to be</p>
<p>practical</p>
<p>now we're going to look at choosing the</p>
<p>right typeface</p>
<p>so what is a typeface well it's actually</p>
<p>the correct</p>
<p>term for what most people would simply</p>
<p>call a font</p>
<p>a font also includes the size</p>
<p>and the style of a typeface so when you</p>
<p>create a ui design</p>
<p>you want to choose a typeface that is</p>
<p>easy to read</p>
<p>and that works in various sizes the most</p>
<p>important thing is that you have to use</p>
<p>it consistently</p>
<p>throughout your ui i want you to</p>
<p>remember back to the worst website</p>
<p>ever that we showed in the first video</p>
<p>this was a great example of</p>
<p>inconsistent font usage i recommend that</p>
<p>you use</p>
<p>a maximum of two typefaces in your ui</p>
<p>design</p>
<p>you can choose between serif or sans</p>
<p>serif fonts</p>
<p>now i don't recommend using scripts or</p>
<p>handwritten fonts</p>
<p>because they can be quite difficult to</p>
<p>read</p>
<p>so what is a serif well serif refers to</p>
<p>the small line or the stroke</p>
<p>that attaches to the end of the larger</p>
<p>stroke in a letter</p>
<p>like the bottom of the blue a sans serif</p>
<p>simply means without serifs examples of</p>
<p>serif fonts</p>
<p>are times new roman and baskerville sans</p>
<p>serifs are typefaces like</p>
<p>ariel helvetica and verdana</p>
<p>serif fonts tend to look more</p>
<p>traditional and they're often used in</p>
<p>newspapers</p>
<p>but if you want a more modern look to</p>
<p>your user interface</p>
<p>i recommend using a sans serif</p>
<p>consistently throughout</p>
<p>so how do you choose font sizes and</p>
<p>weights</p>
<p>well 16 pixels is a good rule of thumb</p>
<p>for both desktop and mobile body text</p>
<p>i don't recommend going any smaller than</p>
<p>this for large sections of text</p>
<p>you can use larger font sizes in your</p>
<p>scale for things that need to be</p>
<p>glanceable</p>
<p>like headings and i would also recommend</p>
<p>steering away from condensed</p>
<p>or thin typefaces another thing to avoid</p>
<p>is using</p>
<p>all lowercase especially if you're using</p>
<p>small font sizes</p>
<p>usability studies have shown that</p>
<p>readability actually goes down</p>
<p>when text is written in all lower case</p>
<p>finally use bold sparingly to emphasize</p>
<p>key areas of text a good example of this</p>
<p>is to make</p>
<p>cards and page headings bold and have</p>
<p>most of the other text on your page</p>
<p>the normal font weight so let's take a</p>
<p>look</p>
<p>at text alignment as i mentioned in</p>
<p>a previous video on visual hierarchy</p>
<p>left aligned text is generally</p>
<p>easier to read than center or right</p>
<p>aligned</p>
<p>this is particularly true in countries</p>
<p>that read from left to right</p>
<p>so here's an example at the bottom of</p>
<p>the slide which one reads easier to you</p>
<p>now let's look at line spacing the web</p>
<p>content accessibility guidelines which</p>
<p>also include the contrast ratio</p>
<p>recommendations</p>
<p>recommend setting your line height or</p>
<p>line spacing</p>
<p>to at least one and a half times the</p>
<p>font size</p>
<p>so what does this mean well if you look</p>
<p>at the examples below you'll see that</p>
<p>the font size is 16 pixels</p>
<p>with one x line height so the line</p>
<p>height for the text on the left is also</p>
<p>16 pixels one and a half times the line</p>
<p>height is going to mean</p>
<p>that the line height is now 16 pixels</p>
<p>times one and a half which is 24.</p>
<p>you'll see an example of this on the</p>
<p>right this adds more breathing room</p>
<p>between text</p>
<p>and also helps to improve readability</p>
<p>the final thing to consider when you're</p>
<p>styling your ui</p>
<p>is to choose a line length that is easy</p>
<p>for users to read</p>
<p>the number of characters in a line has a</p>
<p>big influence on readability</p>
<p>the optimum length also depends on the</p>
<p>device that the user is using</p>
<p>mobile devices have a shorter ideal line</p>
<p>length than desktop</p>
<p>but between 45 to 80 characters is a</p>
<p>good range for all devices</p>
<p>on the left is an example at 71</p>
<p>characters per line</p>
<p>the text on the right is over the 80</p>
<p>character recommendation</p>
<p>and you'll notice that the lines become</p>
<p>too long and quite difficult to read</p>
<p>join me in the next lesson to take a</p>
<p>deeper look at how to use</p>
<p>white space in your interface designs</p>
