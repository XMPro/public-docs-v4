<summary>Transcript</summary>
<p>welcome to another training video from</p>
<p>Mexico in this video we will be</p>
<p>discussing agents and their types agents</p>
<p>are basically a piece of code or logic</p>
<p>which gets encapsulated in Excel Pro</p>
<p>agent framework to become these blocks</p>
<p>which are configurable and reusable</p>
<p>among different use cases we provide a</p>
<p>library of agents which is extensible</p>
<p>and our users have access to the</p>
<p>framework that they can use to create</p>
<p>their own agents and add them to the</p>
<p>library here as you can see agents are</p>
<p>categorized into different categories</p>
<p>there are some fundamental categories</p>
<p>for agents and then there are some which</p>
<p>are derived from them</p>
<p>so I'll go through all of them one by</p>
<p>one so usually a stream starts with a</p>
<p>listener a listener is an agent which</p>
<p>doesn't have any input endpoint it would</p>
<p>always only have an output and that is</p>
<p>primarily responsible to talk to third</p>
<p>party systems or outside and the system</p>
<p>here and fetch new data as it up as it</p>
<p>becomes available</p>
<p>edan can be agents can be of two types</p>
<p>one is a polling agent which basically</p>
<p>has a polling interval on which can be</p>
<p>let's say five seconds ten seconds the</p>
<p>user is allowed to configure that and</p>
<p>that polling interval is what if he uses</p>
<p>to ping its data source or the third</p>
<p>party system to ask for new data so for</p>
<p>example a sequel listener and would ask</p>
<p>the database for new records that may</p>
<p>have become available in last 10 seconds</p>
<p>and then it would push them down on the</p>
<p>string to the next agent the other type</p>
<p>of listeners is the push base where they</p>
<p>don't have any polling mechanism but</p>
<p>they just subscribe to an endpoint and</p>
<p>as soon as something is published on</p>
<p>that endpoint they receive it and they</p>
<p>pass it down the line over here an</p>
<p>example would be an MQTT listener for</p>
<p>example which subscribes to an MQTT</p>
<p>broker</p>
<p>soon as it receives a data point it just</p>
<p>sends it down to the next agent next</p>
<p>category which is very similar to the</p>
<p>listeners is of context providers</p>
<p>context providers also do not have any</p>
<p>input endpoint hence they're usually</p>
<p>also format the start of your stream how</p>
<p>they are different to listeners is that</p>
<p>context providers work with slow</p>
<p>changing for context or reference data</p>
<p>rather than live data which listeners</p>
<p>are listening for context providers just</p>
<p>look at a reference data source cache</p>
<p>them in memory and whenever live data</p>
<p>which is coming at a speed comes through</p>
<p>they are able to provide that context</p>
<p>wire join or some other way to those</p>
<p>records example would be lets say you</p>
<p>have a device which is sending</p>
<p>temperature or a pressure value it</p>
<p>wouldn't be sending its make model when</p>
<p>was last serviced its location etc</p>
<p>though the things which are not changing</p>
<p>so it would only be sending live data</p>
<p>which are the things which mostly</p>
<p>changed as you would receive that</p>
<p>deference better from your context</p>
<p>providers you will do a join on let's</p>
<p>say a device ID and that way you will be</p>
<p>able to add context to your data next we</p>
<p>have transformations transformation is</p>
<p>basically are always found in the middle</p>
<p>of your stream they are required to</p>
<p>change or transform the data the key</p>
<p>difference here is they would rarely or</p>
<p>most probably never be talking to an</p>
<p>outside system there would always be</p>
<p>internal in memory agents which would</p>
<p>receive data change its shape or form</p>
<p>based on how you have configured them</p>
<p>and then output them alone for example</p>
<p>there is a Dalek and we region</p>
<p>transformation what it would do is it</p>
<p>would allow you to change a data type of</p>
<p>a certain attributes for example you may</p>
<p>want to change a string to a number or</p>
<p>vice-versa then I'll jump on to action</p>
<p>action agents are usually found towards</p>
<p>the end of your data stream they are</p>
<p>your call to actions there again agents</p>
<p>which talk to third party systems</p>
<p>outside the this environment and that is</p>
<p>where you would mostly krigger a work</p>
<p>order or or send a notification etc</p>
<p>action agents usually have an input and</p>
<p>an output endpoint where they can</p>
<p>perform the action they were supposed to</p>
<p>and then they would simply pass the same</p>
<p>data point out on their output so that</p>
<p>if you want to create a pipeline or line</p>
<p>up multiple action agents you can do</p>
<p>that and take multiple call to actions</p>
<p>in one for the same data point then if</p>
<p>we come back and we have a category for</p>
<p>AI n machine learning where you will</p>
<p>find agents which are related to machine</p>
<p>learning algorithms like binary</p>
<p>classification anomaly detection etc so</p>
<p>you can use those if you want to call a</p>
<p>model or get a prediction for your data</p>
<p>set next we also have functions which</p>
<p>are basically agents which call some</p>
<p>mathematical function like Fourier</p>
<p>transform or any signal filtering that</p>
<p>you may have to do lastly we have</p>
<p>recommendations these are action agents</p>
<p>which classify and the recommendation</p>
<p>category basically these are the ones</p>
<p>which you use to integrate to app</p>
<p>designer where you can trigger some</p>
<p>recommendations or resolve them as you</p>
<p>may like so that was a brief explanation</p>
<p>of agents and there are different types</p>
<p>thank you so much for watching</p>
