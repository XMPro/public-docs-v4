<summary>Transcript</summary>good and welcome in today's video we're
<p>gonna go through over the data wrangling</p>
<p>we're going to be focusing on raw data</p>
<p>transpose before we go into an example</p>
<p>of that what is data transpose</p>
<p>transposing a data set means converting</p>
<p>a row of data into columns or vice versa</p>
<p>ultimately it's focused on a particular</p>
<p>problem so the problem statement for</p>
<p>this particular data wrangling is when</p>
<p>I'm receiving data by row per parameter</p>
<p>for multiple assets so I'm getting</p>
<p>multiple rows of data coming in how do I</p>
<p>pass a single asset with multiple</p>
<p>parameters to a downstream agent for</p>
<p>example a predictive model or any EAM</p>
<p>integrations to further explain that</p>
<p>what we want to do is we want to go from</p>
<p>multiple rows to a single row for the</p>
<p>asset but with multiple parameters ie</p>
<p>multiple columns</p>
<p>so to do that let's open up an example</p>
<p>and walk through some of the details of</p>
<p>that so the first thing I've got is I've</p>
<p>just got a blank data stream here and</p>
<p>we're going to create this to see the</p>
<p>different results using some of the</p>
<p>transformation agents that we have</p>
<p>before we go into that this is an</p>
<p>example of the data that I'm going to</p>
<p>use this is just a normal CSV it has</p>
<p>just got three columns as a trigger type</p>
<p>and a value and using this I'm going to</p>
<p>create a data stream to just show you</p>
<p>how you can actually wrangle this into</p>
<p>multiple columns and group are the</p>
<p>particular asset themselves so the first</p>
<p>thing that we're going to do is we're</p>
<p>going to drag it on a CSV listener I'm</p>
<p>just going to name it properly</p>
<p>and we're just gonna save that we're</p>
<p>gonna keep this very simple and we're</p>
<p>just going to output it so we can</p>
<p>actually see what does this data look</p>
<p>like coming from the CSV file itself</p>
<p>so now we've got the basic structure of</p>
<p>our data stream set up and configured</p>
<p>what we're looking to do now is this</p>
<p>double-click the CSV we've got our</p>
<p>default collection we've got our default</p>
<p>interval we've only got four records in</p>
<p>there and the CSV reader it takes one</p>
<p>record every 10 seconds based on the</p>
<p>interval here I'm just going to change</p>
<p>this to 5 we can click our select file</p>
<p>and what you'll notice is the CSV list</p>
<p>or actually automatically go through the</p>
<p>file and it'll work out</p>
<p>my definition for me as well so I can</p>
<p>click apply here we can click Save and</p>
<p>if we keep publish and go to the live</p>
<p>view we can actually see what is the</p>
<p>resulting data for this look like</p>
<p>so as you can see every five seconds</p>
<p>we're going to get a record coming from</p>
<p>the CSV listener itself once the CSV</p>
<p>Lister runs out of data we're not going</p>
<p>to get any more records coming in for it</p>
<p>what we want to do is we want to</p>
<p>actually change this now we want to</p>
<p>transpose them so I would like the</p>
<p>pressure and the flow pressure to</p>
<p>actually be columns versus rows so let's</p>
<p>unpublished that what we're going to do</p>
<p>is let's just create a new version for</p>
<p>this and it's going to transformation if</p>
<p>we scroll down to the transpose we'll</p>
<p>just drag that in and we'll just</p>
<p>configure that up again make sure we've</p>
<p>got our name correct so we are gonna</p>
<p>transpose rows to columns and we're</p>
<p>still going to keep the resulting data</p>
<p>set so that we can actually see the data</p>
<p>coming in if we double click the</p>
<p>transpose agent the default is row you</p>
<p>can do columns as well for this video</p>
<p>we're just going to focus on row we want</p>
<p>to group by asset the static columns</p>
<p>ieave which columns do we want to stay</p>
<p>the same in the same order</p>
<p>we'll just keep acid in there as well</p>
<p>the field we want to transpose this</p>
<p>value if I bring you back to the value</p>
<p>is the field that we want to transpose</p>
<p>we want pressure head and flow pressure</p>
<p>to actually be the column names</p>
<p>themselves so field to transpose value</p>
<p>Row 2 transpose will be trigger type and</p>
<p>right at the bottom here what are the</p>
<p>values that it's expecting so pressure</p>
<p>head is the first one and flow pressure</p>
<p>is a second one what it's going to do is</p>
<p>it's going to try and match these two in</p>
<p>the data coming in and it will use that</p>
<p>to convert the road to a column or if</p>
<p>you select the alternate transpose type</p>
<p>it'll do the inverse of that</p>
<p>let's click apply we click save and</p>
<p>let's click publish to see what that</p>
<p>looks like</p>
<p>the first one we just had the CSV going</p>
<p>straight to the resulting data the</p>
<p>second version what we've actually done</p>
<p>here is we've put a transpose in the</p>
<p>middle and we are transposing the</p>
<p>multiple rows into the different columns</p>
<p>and having a look at some of the data</p>
<p>coming out the first thing that you'll</p>
<p>notice in the data coming out is I'm</p>
<p>only getting individual records coming</p>
<p>out what I'd actually like to do is</p>
<p>group them a lot closer to each other</p>
<p>so instead of having to pump two records</p>
<p>coming up I'm actually gonna get one the</p>
<p>same with pump one if I unpublish this</p>
<p>then I republish it together to start</p>
<p>from the beginning of the CSV file</p>
<p>you'll see pump 1 has got its pressure</p>
<p>head pump tours has got its pressure</p>
<p>head and these are coming in at five</p>
<p>second intervals so because of that five</p>
<p>second interval for these new records it</p>
<p>thinks that they are different records</p>
<p>and we actually need to bring them</p>
<p>together so what we're going to do to do</p>
<p>that is if we unpublished this again I'm</p>
<p>just going to create a new version of</p>
<p>this so we can come back to it later</p>
<p>what we going to do different here is</p>
<p>we're going to drag a window on we're</p>
<p>gonna window the data before we actually</p>
<p>pass it through to the transpose and we</p>
<p>are gonna wait for all the data to come</p>
<p>from the CSV before we actually</p>
<p>transpose it so we're just gonna call</p>
<p>this from now we're just going to save</p>
<p>that and if we double click that what</p>
<p>we're interested in is 20 seconds for</p>
<p>records coming in a 5-minute intervals</p>
<p>our size here is gonna be 20 seconds</p>
<p>that we want to actually wait for we can</p>
<p>leave the rest of the settings as</p>
<p>default and now we can save them now if</p>
<p>we run this and go to live view</p>
<p>previously we were getting a record</p>
<p>result coming through every 5 seconds</p>
<p>this time round it's actually going to</p>
<p>wait for 20 seconds then it's going to</p>
<p>pass it to the transpose agent to</p>
<p>convert the rows to columns and then we</p>
<p>will see the results coming out in the</p>
<p>window</p>
<p>the top right</p>
<p>and there we go so after 20 seconds its</p>
<p>buffered the data coming in it's past</p>
<p>that to our transpose agent and now it</p>
<p>can group by them properly and it can</p>
<p>create them into their specific columns</p>
<p>properly if you all remember if we come</p>
<p>back to the excel sheet so this is what</p>
<p>our input data looked like we had</p>
<p>pressure head for pump coming in we had</p>
<p>flow pressure coming in and what we</p>
<p>wanted to do is take that transpose it</p>
<p>so instead of two rows we're going to</p>
<p>get one row of data with multiple</p>
<p>parameters coming in now I can use this</p>
<p>further downstream and I can actually</p>
<p>pass the pressure head to a predictive</p>
<p>model or the pressure head and the flow</p>
<p>pressure to a predictive model is how we</p>
<p>configure a transpose using a data</p>
<p>stream in excel problem</p>
