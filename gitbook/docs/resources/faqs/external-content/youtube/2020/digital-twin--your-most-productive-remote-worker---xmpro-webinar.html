<details>
<summary>Transcript</summary>so welcome to this webinar on digital
<p>twin your most productive remote worker</p>
<p>and we'll look at how to detect and</p>
<p>respond real-time events when your your</p>
<p>team can't be on-site or at the physical</p>
<p>assets the focus all today is wide</p>
<p>dashboards won't solve your remote</p>
<p>monitoring challenges the application of</p>
<p>digital twins for a mud monitoring and</p>
<p>also how to get started with your first</p>
<p>remote monitoring digital twin the goal</p>
<p>of my presentation is to help three</p>
<p>types of people and organizations the</p>
<p>first is those that have already started</p>
<p>on remote monitoring and the digital</p>
<p>twin journey actually as a result of</p>
<p>having to move their control room to the</p>
<p>bedroom as what has happened over the</p>
<p>last couple of weeks with with with many</p>
<p>organizations the second audience is</p>
<p>really those who have already started</p>
<p>implementing some remote monitoring but</p>
<p>it's not really helping to tell the</p>
<p>organization's win key business events</p>
<p>are happening so they've started doing</p>
<p>it but not really that effective and</p>
<p>then lastly the the goal of the</p>
<p>presentation is to help people</p>
<p>organisations who are not going to go</p>
<p>back to the old way of doing things and</p>
<p>that have recognized that the next</p>
<p>normal or the new normal require more</p>
<p>responsive and remote digital</p>
<p>capabilities going forward</p>
<p>so it's not for the laggards I'm Peter</p>
<p>Funt scopic I'm the the chief digital -</p>
<p>an officer at XM Pro and I've worked in</p>
<p>both engineering and IT and I'm probably</p>
<p>version 1.0 of what is called a digital</p>
<p>engineer as we starting to see</p>
<p>traditional engineering skills are now</p>
<p>converging with with digital or IT</p>
<p>skills I have a passion for solving</p>
<p>complex problems and being actively</p>
<p>involved in the industry internet</p>
<p>searching with a number of initiatives</p>
<p>including digital twins and I've</p>
<p>contributed articles to Forbes through</p>
<p>the folks Technology Council but I've</p>
<p>also had the opportunity to kind of work</p>
<p>firsthand with digital twins and look at</p>
<p>how they impact operations and</p>
<p>maintenance in a number of the</p>
<p>industries that we work in</p>
<p>and I take some prior trying to a</p>
<p>few licks or of those examples with you</p>
<p>today so one of the things that we've</p>
<p>seen with the covert 19 pandemic is that</p>
<p>it's impacted different industries in</p>
<p>different ways and but for most of us it</p>
<p>has actually changed the way that we</p>
<p>work day to day</p>
<p>Jarrod's Patara was on the interview</p>
<p>with such an Adele a couple of weeks ago</p>
<p>when he said we will never go back to</p>
<p>the way that we that we worked in the</p>
<p>past and in a different thought leaders</p>
<p>and analysts agree that you know the way</p>
<p>that we thought we were going to work in</p>
<p>five to seven years time from now is</p>
<p>actually how we started working two or</p>
<p>three months ago we all expected to work</p>
<p>from anyway that capability but we never</p>
<p>thought it would be forcibly</p>
<p>fast-tracked to us and this combined</p>
<p>with the maturity of emerging</p>
<p>technologies like IOT cloud age AI</p>
<p>machine learning all of that is creating</p>
<p>a perfect storm for event based remote</p>
<p>monitoring and digital twins so before</p>
<p>yeah so what we covered today is really</p>
<p>why dashboards won't solve your remote</p>
<p>monitoring challenges we see a number of</p>
<p>customers trying to start there and with</p>
<p>that I might like to share with you how</p>
<p>we stumbled on this event based remote</p>
<p>monitoring drones while working at a</p>
<p>fortune thin super major oil company in</p>
<p>in it was actually in 2014 so we've been</p>
<p>around this space for a while and one of</p>
<p>the number of challenges that they had</p>
<p>was trying to address how to schedule</p>
<p>their truck rolls for cruise around</p>
<p>compliances inspections and that that</p>
<p>work impacted the production yield on</p>
<p>their on the oil field so they try to</p>
<p>manage this with spreadsheets and bi</p>
<p>dashboards and and the challenge is that</p>
<p>the decisions that they made were on</p>
<p>were done on style data that was</p>
<p>actually sent to a title like with batch</p>
<p>by CT else I think a lot of you are</p>
<p>familiar with that kind of thing</p>
<p>and you know extra fact some of the data</p>
<p>lag by as much as 24 hours</p>
<p>the dashboards required a skilled</p>
<p>engineer to interpret and look at it and</p>
<p>decide on what actions need to be done</p>
<p>and and when that engineer one person</p>
<p>suddenly had to take extended paternity</p>
<p>leave no one knew how to interpret the</p>
<p>the dashboards itself so decisions were</p>
<p>typically made on on information that</p>
<p>was that was out date and didn't really</p>
<p>reflect what was happening around</p>
<p>operations and maintenance events and</p>
<p>there was also no way to link those</p>
<p>actions and those decisions with his</p>
<p>work actually being done because there</p>
<p>was no way to track the dashboard versus</p>
<p>the actual work they needed to do so we</p>
<p>need to try to build that into our BPM</p>
<p>or workflow engine but we realized that</p>
<p>the sheer volume of streaming data</p>
<p>needed to do this in real time kind of</p>
<p>needed a whole new approach so we</p>
<p>created a remote monitoring digital twin</p>
<p>built on event-driven architecture and</p>
<p>I'll spend a bit more time on that and</p>
<p>it's really for real-time operational</p>
<p>intelligence and we call it event</p>
<p>intelligence so it's about that</p>
<p>real-time what are the key events that</p>
<p>are happening so you know when we got</p>
<p>this right we saved them eight million</p>
<p>dollars in six months and we also</p>
<p>reduced the truck rolls for those</p>
<p>services by eighteen percent so again</p>
<p>looking at some of the challenges that</p>
<p>we see with bi styled dashboards kind of</p>
<p>my two main ones is the one is access to</p>
<p>real time data and the other one is</p>
<p>closing the loop so we briefly touch on</p>
<p>those and remember kind of the data like</p>
<p>way the oil and gas customer trying to</p>
<p>put all the information and then with</p>
<p>the reporting on the challenge where</p>
<p>that is that you are using bi style2</p>
<p>tools to do that way we first stole and</p>
<p>then we analyzed and what real-time</p>
<p>remote monitoring requires is actually</p>
<p>access the real-time streaming data</p>
<p>where you analyze and if you you may or</p>
<p>may not store the information so as it</p>
<p>happens you need to analyze it very</p>
<p>quickly gotten actually graded or really</p>
<p>and just by the way um what what we've</p>
<p>seen</p>
<p>is the tip of the iceberg or the easy</p>
<p>part is what we store the harder part</p>
<p>and what you really need and the thing</p>
<p>that that that that the sink many IOT</p>
<p>projects or remote monitoring projects</p>
<p>is the fact that there's expectation</p>
<p>that those dashboards can do that the</p>
<p>the top part what what we forget is that</p>
<p>there's a the the mass of the body</p>
<p>actually resides under this gardener as</p>
<p>a nice way of explaining this and this</p>
<p>is from a gardener slide but really if</p>
<p>you look at bi and all of those we store</p>
<p>and then you analyze versus what we see</p>
<p>from continuous operations intelligence</p>
<p>or event intelligence where it's kind of</p>
<p>embedded in the business process and as</p>
<p>you can see we analyze as it happens</p>
<p>which is reflected by the process it</p>
<p>gives us situational awareness it's</p>
<p>always on pushes the information to us</p>
<p>but it also orchestrates why do we need</p>
<p>to do when that happens prescriptive</p>
<p>action and the whole idea is that we</p>
<p>close the loop so it is a process that</p>
<p>you can build around this and by the way</p>
<p>you can store data if you want to then</p>
<p>which is reflected there a better way of</p>
<p>looking at this as well is also from a</p>
<p>remote monitoring perspective time</p>
<p>relevance of data is really really</p>
<p>important so when a key business event</p>
<p>happens and that might be that we can</p>
<p>predict something's going to file or</p>
<p>that are that are operational that you</p>
<p>need to make operational changes or</p>
<p>something like that when that event</p>
<p>happens the information that we have</p>
<p>then start appreciating very quickly</p>
<p>once we know something is likely to</p>
<p>happen or happening in some instance we</p>
<p>have you know the information starts</p>
<p>depreciating within a second a minute an</p>
<p>hour or a day which you see at the top</p>
<p>and when it's completely there's nothing</p>
<p>I can do about it anymore</p>
<p>a slightly different time cycle and we</p>
<p>have this window of opportunity that sit</p>
<p>between the two and that's the time that</p>
<p>we have to respond so we typically want</p>
<p>to know when these key events are</p>
<p>happening and just remember these</p>
<p>revenue yellow dots I'll get back to</p>
<p>them a little bit lighter but those are</p>
<p>key things that we want to know and what</p>
<p>we've seen is business intelligence is</p>
<p>when the sand was settled I can go back</p>
<p>and analyze you know below the line when</p>
<p>it's had</p>
<p>and and I can understand how many file</p>
<p>is that I have why did I have it from a</p>
<p>feint intelligence that's the sign</p>
<p>that's still in flight it's something</p>
<p>that I could potentially still impact</p>
<p>and that is what the benefit that we see</p>
<p>with remote monitoring so if you get</p>
<p>this right and this is an example of a</p>
<p>mining customer that started out with</p>
<p>Excel and B I'm not going to spend too</p>
<p>much time on this but every single red</p>
<p>cross that you see is when equipment</p>
<p>filed that cost the impact of this was</p>
<p>literally millions of dollars and 41</p>
<p>hours of downtime on equipment and I'll</p>
<p>show you a little bit more of that</p>
<p>environment in in a minute but these are</p>
<p>the conveyor belts underground 1.2</p>
<p>kilometers underground 80 kilometers of</p>
<p>conveyor and these are failures on these</p>
<p>conveyors trying to manage it with Excel</p>
<p>and bi</p>
<p>only getting to it you know once a week</p>
<p>once they've implemented the XM Pro</p>
<p>monitoring capability from a digital</p>
<p>twin for the for the for those</p>
<p>underground conveyors you can see the</p>
<p>impact that it's had because we can do</p>
<p>that now at scale the monitoring twin</p>
<p>can do this every two seconds we can</p>
<p>give them advance notice and we can tie</p>
<p>it back into you know are we actually</p>
<p>going when we tell you something's</p>
<p>happening are you going to do it and</p>
<p>this is actually the the environment so</p>
<p>this is a under this is a borer</p>
<p>underground 1.2 kilometers underground</p>
<p>and the stuff that or a camp that comes</p>
<p>out of this goes onto a conveyor belt</p>
<p>which when this project initiated and</p>
<p>you know we took this initial snapshot</p>
<p>of in the in the early version of of</p>
<p>wind and this is looking at conveyors</p>
<p>you can just see the red and yellow dots</p>
<p>you can see a lot of problems and some</p>
<p>of this resulted in in in high downtime</p>
<p>the the second part is what we took a</p>
<p>coupla days ago so you can see how it is</p>
<p>actually changed in terms of being able</p>
<p>to monitor this better the interesting</p>
<p>part of this is the person who knows how</p>
<p>to do this their reliability engineer</p>
<p>that can look at the recommend that can</p>
<p>look at the event provide a</p>
<p>recommendation if someone has been there</p>
<p>45 years lots of experience and it's</p>
<p>actually someone who is at risk at the</p>
<p>moment in terms of</p>
<p>the curve at nineteen virus so that</p>
<p>person is working from home he's been</p>
<p>able to do all of this from home for the</p>
<p>last couple of weeks so you can see the</p>
<p>benefit of having moving the control</p>
<p>room to the bedroom but bringing that</p>
<p>remote monitoring digital to</p>
<p>incapability into it and the from our</p>
<p>perspective there's a big difference</p>
<p>between what you do on a dashboard this</p>
<p>is what we refer to as an event board</p>
<p>and which is this digital twin that</p>
<p>represents where are the key events that</p>
<p>are happening and I'm not interested in</p>
<p>the speeds and feeds and I don't need to</p>
<p>know what the tank level is I just need</p>
<p>to know if there's a problem with that</p>
<p>tank and what do I need to do when that</p>
<p>happens so that's kind of the first</p>
<p>issue that we have with bi style</p>
<p>dashboards and and things like that</p>
<p>where the second part is really how do</p>
<p>we close the loop and I'm gonna talk a</p>
<p>little bit around that by showing you</p>
<p>some applications and by what I mean by</p>
<p>closing the loop and with looking at</p>
<p>some applications of digital twins for a</p>
<p>my cracking I wrote a article in Forbes</p>
<p>not too long ago around how to hire the</p>
<p>right digital twin for your company and</p>
<p>will provide this link to you in the in</p>
<p>with the recording that we send out</p>
<p>later but when you look at a digital</p>
<p>twin it's very similar to hiring a</p>
<p>person in your organization and there</p>
<p>are key things that you want is to this</p>
<p>this thing to do so kind of the the</p>
<p>identified three major jobs that we hire</p>
<p>digital twins to do the first one is</p>
<p>just tell me what's going on that's the</p>
<p>status twin the next one is you know</p>
<p>tell me what I should be doing digital</p>
<p>twin which is our operational</p>
<p>interacting it's kind of giving me</p>
<p>advice and an interactive and then the</p>
<p>last one it's kind of the Oracle in the</p>
<p>organisation it it's the tell me what if</p>
<p>scenario simulation predictions</p>
<p>capability that we see with digital to</p>
<p>ontology to go and read that that</p>
<p>article explains it in a lot more detail</p>
<p>but I thought I'd show you some examples</p>
<p>now ignore what you see on the bottom</p>
<p>right which is the recommendations</p>
<p>because we just can't help ourselves we</p>
<p>have to kind of shove it but for the</p>
<p>rest what you see is a typical status</p>
<p>TWEN what is happening right now - and I</p>
<p>can get a view on on different aspects</p>
<p>and this is built in XM Pro this is a</p>
<p>slightly different so this is an example</p>
<p>of an operational twin so again this</p>
<p>tells me where certain things are</p>
<p>happening so if you look at the previous</p>
<p>one I don't see any see any real red</p>
<p>dots or events or anything like that I</p>
<p>just see I know what's the status now I</p>
<p>see there are problems in certain areas</p>
<p>like at the pumps and and things like</p>
<p>that and this is also recommendations</p>
<p>associated with each one of those so if</p>
<p>you look at the bump the the dot in them</p>
<p>over here you'll see there's a</p>
<p>recommended recommendation associated</p>
<p>with that specific pump and also there's</p>
<p>some information around how good are we</p>
<p>at resolving this so kind of connecting</p>
<p>back to our weave are we fixing this and</p>
<p>how good are we and you'll see this is a</p>
<p>constant pattern that we repeat in these</p>
<p>remote monitoring digital twins this is</p>
<p>that same one with a little bit more</p>
<p>simulation capability so this runs a uni</p>
<p>a Unity gaming engine at the back and</p>
<p>you can drill down and fly in and in the</p>
<p>prison in the demonstration a little bit</p>
<p>later I might get to that and so the the</p>
<p>but this is the real area that you know</p>
<p>we when you look at a simulation twin or</p>
<p>something like that and this is what's</p>
<p>actually done by one of our partners</p>
<p>they are on the call so this is a</p>
<p>simulation when that does casting</p>
<p>guidance for blast furnaces is their IP</p>
<p>there's some really smart models and</p>
<p>things that sit at the back what you see</p>
<p>it over here this is actually a unity</p>
<p>based model that can move up and down</p>
<p>I'm not going to get into the specifics</p>
<p>of how this works but with this I can</p>
<p>run scenarios I can do all sorts of</p>
<p>things again taking real-time monitoring</p>
<p>data and providing costing guidance -</p>
<p>and operate</p>
<p>who needs to make decisions the the</p>
<p>benefit of this again doing model tuning</p>
<p>and and and setting up new scenarios can</p>
<p>be done remotely by people who are not</p>
<p>on site who might actually be sitting in</p>
<p>their bedroom again again this is done</p>
<p>by one of our partners if you're</p>
<p>interested in in in this application and</p>
<p>they've specialized the engineering firm</p>
<p>who does this happy to if you contact me</p>
<p>happy to share their contact details</p>
<p>with you and you can explore how this</p>
<p>could apply to your business so in terms</p>
<p>of closing the loop which is the last</p>
<p>part so what we often see is there there</p>
<p>are multiple systems that provide and</p>
<p>that's one of the challenges with</p>
<p>dashboards is kind of how do we close</p>
<p>the loop I can see information um I have</p>
<p>all these systems that give me alerts</p>
<p>but what I'm really trying to do is is</p>
<p>kind of connect that up to an action and</p>
<p>with those events that you solve</p>
<p>triggered earlier those red dots and</p>
<p>yellow dots this is a recommendation for</p>
<p>each of those that you can set up and it</p>
<p>shows the real-time information that</p>
<p>that triggered that event a</p>
<p>recommendation from that engineer who's</p>
<p>been there 45 years and it's now working</p>
<p>from his bedroom and some interaction</p>
<p>with and putting out work instructions</p>
<p>and you can even bring in work order</p>
<p>information and some of the other</p>
<p>components the way that we set that up</p>
<p>is we wire that up and this is again</p>
<p>something that you can you can give the</p>
<p>digital twins some intelligence some</p>
<p>rules that it needs to follow to figure</p>
<p>out how to trigger those key events by</p>
<p>by setting up rules and this is fed from</p>
<p>an XM probe data stream if you look at</p>
<p>the XMP idea stream it is that thing</p>
<p>that sits under the water when you look</p>
<p>at the iceberg the big mass or body</p>
<p>master that then that was sitting there</p>
<p>so again looking at that mining</p>
<p>organization closing the loop for them</p>
<p>in that they also not only understood</p>
<p>what the key events or but how often</p>
<p>those we triggered how people</p>
<p>responded to them how long it took to</p>
<p>actually resolve some of them and again</p>
<p>this changed significantly from when it</p>
<p>started and it moved from a dashboard</p>
<p>Excel environment into a monitoring twin</p>
<p>and that has got feedback loop so I just</p>
<p>lastly just want to touch on how to get</p>
<p>into your first digital twin and I'll do</p>
<p>that by explaining a little bit in terms</p>
<p>of our methodology but then take you</p>
<p>into showing you how you would actually</p>
<p>do that using our application now we've</p>
<p>created this lean digital twin canvas</p>
<p>it's bold it's it's basically a business</p>
<p>model canvas that we've adapted for a</p>
<p>lean digital twin it's kind of the one</p>
<p>page view if you had to add one slide</p>
<p>that you can present to your executive</p>
<p>to get funding for this digital - and</p>
<p>what would you put on that and the</p>
<p>numbering that you see on here it's kind</p>
<p>of the sequence that you that you put</p>
<p>this together so if you started on a</p>
<p>digital twin is and that's what's what's</p>
<p>the problem that I'm trying to solve we</p>
<p>often see people start with I have this</p>
<p>data what can I do is it it's kind of</p>
<p>the wrong end what you know you need to</p>
<p>focus on what is the problem that I'm</p>
<p>trying to solve who will be my customer</p>
<p>will be the user of this remote</p>
<p>monitoring for example what is the value</p>
<p>prop that for this and and what does the</p>
<p>solution compile consists of so what are</p>
<p>we going to include in that what are</p>
<p>some of the challenges that we might</p>
<p>have and and as you can see the business</p>
<p>guys the key matrix that we are going to</p>
<p>measure to make sure that this is a</p>
<p>success how can we establish a baseline</p>
<p>and then what will this cost and what</p>
<p>integration challenges maybe have in</p>
<p>what way do we need to get the data from</p>
<p>this is really the job description for</p>
<p>that digital twin that you want to hire</p>
<p>once you've got that it makes it a lot</p>
<p>easier to go into how our standard</p>
<p>approach of developing digital twins it</p>
<p>always thoughts with what is the problem</p>
<p>that this from work monitoring digital</p>
<p>twin will be solving for you and kind of</p>
<p>we've divided it into three main</p>
<p>components again we need to look at what</p>
<p>are the</p>
<p>we need to get the data stream so once</p>
<p>we know what the problem is we've gone</p>
<p>through you know what are the key</p>
<p>metrics and what are the leading</p>
<p>indicators that we're trying to get to</p>
<p>we they need to see so how do we get</p>
<p>that data streaming into our rules and</p>
<p>you can see again this we've broken it</p>
<p>down into easy chunks of work to do how</p>
<p>can we then define what those and those</p>
<p>rules and recommendations how would we</p>
<p>actually give that to someone in the</p>
<p>event board with notifications and and</p>
<p>also integrated into existing systems</p>
<p>like EAM and ERP and some of the other</p>
<p>things and this is kind of the this</p>
<p>standard way that we look at doing</p>
<p>things so kind of the three steps that</p>
<p>we follow in doing this in the first</p>
<p>step is we will create the data streams</p>
<p>and I'll show you that in a minute</p>
<p>we then set up recommendation rules and</p>
<p>then we create the visualizations and</p>
<p>the front-end for for this so that's</p>
<p>kind of the three simple steps in terms</p>
<p>of how to get started so with that maxsa</p>
<p>going to show you a live example and</p>
<p>just want to get that across a layer and</p>
<p>I'm just going to open up X and press</p>
<p>suite</p>
<p>this is the standard Exim Pro module so</p>
<p>we'll start off as a as I mentioned with</p>
<p>the data streams so this is where we get</p>
<p>the data into our digital twin now that</p>
<p>we know what the problem is and again</p>
<p>always thought with what is the problem</p>
<p>that you're trying to solve so you'll</p>
<p>see we refer to these actually as use</p>
<p>cases what are the use cases that you</p>
<p>want to do and it might be I just want</p>
<p>to confirm that everyone can see my</p>
<p>screen so oh cool got confirmation yet</p>
<p>you can see my screen so this is where</p>
<p>we bring data in and these are built</p>
<p>around specific again use cases or</p>
<p>applications and if I look at something</p>
<p>like maybe a center that's in traffic or</p>
<p>pump that we saw the red dot that we saw</p>
<p>on there I'm not going to run through</p>
<p>the whole thing here but the whole idea</p>
<p>is how can I set up a data workflow for</p>
<p>my hundred pumps or 200 pumps using one</p>
<p>data workflow I can I bump the data in</p>
<p>from all of them I'm getting it from</p>
<p>time series data or maybe some protocol</p>
<p>and I'll do that by listeners drag and</p>
<p>drop and again a whole library of this</p>
<p>there are separate videos that cover</p>
<p>this on our Learning Channel</p>
<p>and so urge you to go and have a look at</p>
<p>those if you're more interested in this</p>
<p>context where do we give the mic and</p>
<p>model from a side B and other</p>
<p>applications like that and then how do I</p>
<p>set up some analytics for this and</p>
<p>wrangle the data how do I bring in and</p>
<p>then go and call a predictive model for</p>
<p>example in this instance and then in</p>
<p>what's what's nice with this is you can</p>
<p>also change predictive models and this</p>
<p>one will predict that it's likely to</p>
<p>file an enema go and run a completely</p>
<p>different predictive model and again all</p>
<p>of these X and Pro comes boxed was a</p>
<p>bunch of AI and machine learning</p>
<p>capability already the drag-and-drop</p>
<p>anja so you can buy kit into into your</p>
<p>data flow that's really where you want</p>
<p>to use this transformations is just how</p>
<p>you wrangle the data and and do</p>
<p>calculations and things like that</p>
<p>functions is where</p>
<p>Bly and maybe first careers or something</p>
<p>if I want to look at bearing vibration</p>
<p>and the last thing is I want to create</p>
<p>some actions I want to see nowadays and</p>
<p>missus I want to send it into the XM Pro</p>
<p>managing work orders and then or into</p>
<p>ASAP or Maxima or in for that doesn't</p>
<p>matter what the system is that you're</p>
<p>sending into but I also want to run</p>
<p>these recommendation rules so again a</p>
<p>bunch of capability but what I wanted to</p>
<p>get across here is and you know all of</p>
<p>these are pretty easy to set up the</p>
<p>whole idea is you can construct the the</p>
<p>veins that flow or the blood that</p>
<p>through flow through the veins of your</p>
<p>digital twin through this this is kind</p>
<p>of like the blood that that that flows</p>
<p>through that and again pretty easy to</p>
<p>set up the different systems to be able</p>
<p>to talk to and create the logic that I</p>
<p>want to feed the information for my</p>
<p>real-time monitoring to and so this now</p>
<p>tells me from a monitoring perspective</p>
<p>what's happening to this bump so that's</p>
<p>the first part the second now that we</p>
<p>know that and we've sent it on to our</p>
<p>recommendation rules so there's some</p>
<p>data coming out of this pipe okay</p>
<p>actually go and have a look at that</p>
<p>quickly before we look at the actual</p>
<p>applications and screens itself so if I</p>
<p>look at the recommendations and actually</p>
<p>just going so this is all the</p>
<p>recommendations and there are different</p>
<p>ways that you can manage and I'm</p>
<p>actually going to resolve that one</p>
<p>because I want to show that these fire</p>
<p>in terms of real time but before but so</p>
<p>I couldn't manage them at a high level</p>
<p>but what I'm what I'm what I want to do</p>
<p>is actually show you how we set them up</p>
<p>so if I look at that discharge pressure</p>
<p>on the pump the one that created that</p>
<p>red dot was actually this one but it's</p>
<p>only got one rule in so I will actually</p>
<p>have a look at the second one which has</p>
<p>got an additional rule so you can see I</p>
<p>can bold rules on this incoming data</p>
<p>remember this</p>
<p>so my digital twin</p>
<p>blood Turing the flowing through the</p>
<p>veins is now sending me in some</p>
<p>information that it's collected along</p>
<p>the way that information I can now use</p>
<p>to set up a recommendation to say well</p>
<p>when this condition occurred make it a</p>
<p>red condition or a yellow condition or</p>
<p>whatever it is or medium or high or</p>
<p>whatever the case might might be angry</p>
<p>eyes some response that I need I want to</p>
<p>know what with work instructions and and</p>
<p>integrating it into our existing</p>
<p>workflow cyst or ein system and adding</p>
<p>resources like video clips on how to fix</p>
<p>this bump but in order to do that I need</p>
<p>to set up a rule and this rule the data</p>
<p>that you see coming out of this is</p>
<p>actually the data coming out of this</p>
<p>pipe over here so that is how we connect</p>
<p>and that's the part that's often missing</p>
<p>in dashboards you can't do that you can</p>
<p>I'll show you a dashboard in a minute or</p>
<p>if input but without this capability of</p>
<p>bringing data at scale being an analyzer</p>
<p>bring it down to what you need and this</p>
<p>board is is the part that you need to</p>
<p>set up these rules and recommendations</p>
<p>to make your event you know this will do</p>
<p>in any event when that will tell you and</p>
<p>by the way you know this could also be</p>
<p>that I want to say that the flow rate is</p>
<p>less than the feed right so you can</p>
<p>build some really interesting rules and</p>
<p>this is actually maintained by that</p>
<p>engineer working from home who's been</p>
<p>there 45 years he knows what the rules</p>
<p>are and also and we have also invested</p>
<p>in building this rule the rule discovery</p>
<p>through AI topic for a separate webinar</p>
<p>but in this instance it's actually set</p>
<p>up by and the recommended actions by</p>
<p>that person has been there 45 years a</p>
<p>great way to capture and make a digital</p>
<p>to an intelligent using the knowledge of</p>
<p>people who's been there a long time and</p>
<p>understand what they're looking at and</p>
<p>translate that into and codify that into</p>
<p>into a real tongue digital twin so this</p>
<p>is the the recommendation now that we</p>
<p>have that let's see what it looks like</p>
<p>if I go</p>
<p>look at what that recommendation</p>
<p>actually does and I'll quickly go in and</p>
<p>look at so if we look at a at a at a</p>
<p>mining plant for example and a</p>
<p>processing plant on a mine what you'll</p>
<p>see conveyors there's there's a pump and</p>
<p>there's the equipment I can see there is</p>
<p>an issue with that I can see how long</p>
<p>we're currently taking to do some of the</p>
<p>things but they will see that there's</p>
<p>actually discharge exception on this</p>
<p>pump but I'd actually like to understand</p>
<p>more around the pump pump so this is</p>
<p>capability that I now have from a remote</p>
<p>monitoring digital to an I'm sitting in</p>
<p>my bedroom and I can see the information</p>
<p>if I'd want to drill down into some of</p>
<p>the other organizational data sources</p>
<p>like in this instance the historian</p>
<p>that's got the history of the last 20</p>
<p>years of this pump collected I don't</p>
<p>need that right now if I have lost seven</p>
<p>days I've got enough and and I could</p>
<p>actually even have the work order</p>
<p>information from the I said from the</p>
<p>same system whatever display on on this</p>
<p>as well and yeah I can see some of the</p>
<p>key metrics but I can also look at what</p>
<p>the recommendation is around that pump</p>
<p>and what you'll see in this instance</p>
<p>there is the data that triggered so the</p>
<p>data that's coming through from my data</p>
<p>stream is not has now triggered that</p>
<p>condition that we set and that condition</p>
<p>these are the actual values that created</p>
<p>it</p>
<p>I can then create and a comment or</p>
<p>instruction I can then assign it to the</p>
<p>work order management system either</p>
<p>automatically or depending on how the</p>
<p>organization want to use these</p>
<p>recommendations so that's one way of</p>
<p>kind of closing the loop and why a</p>
<p>dashboard doesn't give you that</p>
<p>capability doesn't give you the ability</p>
<p>to see to back to command and control</p>
<p>and give the feedback and if we look at</p>
<p>one or two other examples</p>
<p>on this it could be as simple you know</p>
<p>it doesn't always have to be fancy</p>
<p>pictures like the previous one that I</p>
<p>showed you it could be some something as</p>
<p>simple as now these are all my conveyors</p>
<p>and I can see the health score again I</p>
<p>would get alerted when some of these</p>
<p>with the red condition and I get SMS</p>
<p>with the yellow condition and I get an</p>
<p>email and I would know what what the</p>
<p>recommended action is and what the data</p>
<p>was that would triggered it I could</p>
<p>drill down in a similar way a different</p>
<p>view of what a digital twinness it's not</p>
<p>always a fancy 3d CAD model or something</p>
<p>like that but if we if we were to do</p>
<p>that in extra fact let me show you an</p>
<p>example of just a close of an example</p>
<p>that is more sophisticated so this is a</p>
<p>water treatment plant and this digital</p>
<p>twin actually runs a a unity gaming 3d</p>
<p>rendering of the real-time data so it</p>
<p>will see this is my real-time plant I've</p>
<p>got some bumps and things here and I can</p>
<p>navigate and go into and actually and if</p>
<p>I just like different views then I can</p>
<p>actually draw in and you know what</p>
<p>you'll see what it does it actually</p>
<p>shows me the condition and there you can</p>
<p>see the real-time data stream so again</p>
<p>there is action agent in here that will</p>
<p>anything from smart contracts on through</p>
<p>to things like unity models and we can</p>
<p>we can make the digital the remote</p>
<p>monitoring digital to an really really</p>
<p>intelligent with different capabilities</p>
<p>but the real but the real time data and</p>
<p>get through the recommendations in</p>
<p>everything that you see is still exactly</p>
<p>the same and serious got a question for</p>
<p>me which is probably a leading to into</p>
<p>the next section on our webinar so that</p>
<p>is the the way that we put this</p>
<p>twins together we start with the data</p>
<p>stream within create recommendations</p>
<p>that we want and conditions and then we</p>
<p>create the actual application and the</p>
<p>way that we put these applications</p>
<p>together if I just quickly go back to an</p>
<p>example like this conveyor acid one it's</p>
<p>pretty easy to to create these</p>
<p>applications inside example I have</p>
<p>rights so I can edit this one I</p>
<p>shouldn't because our precise theme will</p>
<p>be will will have to go and and roll it</p>
<p>back right if I update the version but</p>
<p>this is how I build and design so I can</p>
<p>layout I can drag things on yeah I can</p>
<p>make areas like this a widget and they</p>
<p>reuse that widget so you'll see we've</p>
<p>got widgets and then you can very easy</p>
<p>to actually build it out but you don't</p>
<p>start here you don't start with the</p>
<p>dashboard you start with what is the</p>
<p>data stream what are the recommendations</p>
<p>that sit behind it and then how do I</p>
<p>want to visualize it and show it to</p>
<p>people</p>
<p>so with that time for any questions that</p>
<p>you may have on on this so leave a few</p>
<p>minutes for for questions and answers</p>
<p>and if you're interested well you know</p>
<p>we can help you</p>
<p>using our three-step process we can help</p>
<p>you to build a real-time and digital</p>
<p>twin monitoring twin that can connect</p>
<p>the data and kind of give you that</p>
<p>unbiased right timing information so</p>
<p>that you know what you're looking at and</p>
<p>you can track the leading indicators for</p>
<p>key events with that so that any</p>
<p>questions</p>
<p>there is one I'm just going to open up</p>
<p>the question box the world virtual</p>
<p>coffee be provided so I think one of the</p>
<p>interesting things with these digital</p>
<p>twins and thank you for that question so</p>
<p>I think one of the interesting things</p>
<p>with these these digital twins is you're</p>
<p>only limited by your imagination in</p>
<p>terms of what you can put together and I</p>
<p>always use the example of traditional</p>
<p>status twin is something if you think</p>
<p>about your car it is like your fuel</p>
<p>gauge you can see what the level of the</p>
<p>fuel is and you need to be an</p>
<p>experienced operator if you've been</p>
<p>driving for a number of years you'll</p>
<p>know exactly what what that means when</p>
<p>it's high or low and whether you can get</p>
<p>to your destination that's kind of</p>
<p>typically what what we see with bi star</p>
<p>which is it's it's that when we look at</p>
<p>some smarter solutions</p>
<p>you know the lightest versions of the</p>
<p>Tesla's if I put my GPS if I put my GPS</p>
<p>coordinates in I can actually the the</p>
<p>call will will look at the charge that</p>
<p>is got it will determine whether it can</p>
<p>actually get to that destination if it</p>
<p>can't it will flag that it's an event it</p>
<p>will then look at so this is</p>
<p>intelligence that you can build into</p>
<p>twin like this it can then look at what</p>
<p>are the charging stations on the way</p>
<p>where is an open slot in one of those</p>
<p>charging stations and do you want me to</p>
<p>book it for you obviously that will</p>
<p>optimize everything and once you once</p>
<p>you there and answer your question</p>
<p>around the virtual coffee well what you</p>
<p>can actually do is if there's a</p>
<p>Starbucks nearby you can actually at the</p>
<p>digital to an order your stop your</p>
<p>Starbucks coffee and and and donat while</p>
<p>your car is being charged I know it's a</p>
<p>little bit of a different kind of take</p>
<p>on that but yeah so I think the other</p>
<p>some of the other</p>
<p>around years how long does how long does</p>
<p>it take to create a digital twin like</p>
<p>this of typically do we have a six week</p>
<p>program from and you can find</p>
<p>information on our website as well we</p>
<p>have a six week kickstart program where</p>
<p>right from the start we you have a</p>
<p>digital twin delivering value is is</p>
<p>typically around a six week window</p>
<p>depending on on access to data and how</p>
<p>much you want to do in-house so one of</p>
<p>our objectives is to try and your people</p>
<p>to be able to do this yourself</p>
<p>the there's a question around issue of a</p>
<p>three step approach applicable for</p>
<p>building a supply chain digital to an</p>
<p>absolutely we've built a digital to an</p>
<p>around supply chain solution for a</p>
<p>really large multinational organization</p>
<p>and it follows exactly the same thing we</p>
<p>need to understand kind of what the key</p>
<p>objectives were and the instance it was</p>
<p>sort of inventory planning then you know</p>
<p>what are that the the data real-time</p>
<p>data that they need and how do we get</p>
<p>access to that and how do we get it into</p>
<p>a shape by using a in the into a shape</p>
<p>that I could use it to create</p>
<p>recommendations and those</p>
<p>recommendations around short-term</p>
<p>inventory planning and then lastly how</p>
<p>do we now show that is someone and how</p>
<p>do we tell them to do something and how</p>
<p>do we integrate and I actually use ASAP</p>
<p>as the backend and the question so I'm</p>
<p>just running through them quickly have</p>
<p>you have you integrate your platform</p>
<p>with clamp point models or models yes so</p>
<p>the a number of of different ones and</p>
<p>one of the interesting digital twin</p>
<p>knots if you call it technology or</p>
<p>platforms that are emerging or for</p>
<p>example the Microsoft digital twin which</p>
<p>is really a BIM model</p>
<p>and integrating the information out of</p>
<p>that yes so managing the data flow is</p>
<p>the key yes absolutely so it's not about</p>
<p>the visualization it's and thank you for</p>
<p>that question</p>
<p>it is about how do I get the data from</p>
<p>the real time sources how do I reduce</p>
<p>the lag how do I make sure that I don't</p>
<p>necessarily store but I just I analyze</p>
<p>and then decide if I want to store but</p>
<p>that is kind of the biggest challenge</p>
<p>that we see with us with this question</p>
<p>is how do we handle potential false</p>
<p>alarms great question one of the things</p>
<p>that we've done initially and again</p>
<p>we've been around the spice for a while</p>
<p>we and we made a number of mistakes as</p>
<p>we as we went along this one of the</p>
<p>first things that we try to do is take</p>
<p>that data stream and push it and have a</p>
<p>predictive model and then push it</p>
<p>directly into a seppie or Maxima</p>
<p>whatever the case might be ended up with</p>
<p>false positives and every single time</p>
<p>you send out someone to go and have a</p>
<p>look at a machine and they get there and</p>
<p>there's nothing wrong with it you lose</p>
<p>credibility so that's one of the reasons</p>
<p>why the recommendations are and one of</p>
<p>the things that you'll see on the</p>
<p>recommendation is was this</p>
<p>recommendation success did it resolve it</p>
<p>yes or no and the other option is you</p>
<p>can actually say was this a false</p>
<p>positive so that you can go and tune</p>
<p>your model and and there's always at the</p>
<p>moment there's it's not decision</p>
<p>automation it's decision support so</p>
<p>we're not one of the downfalls as we</p>
<p>started off trying to do one of the</p>
<p>challenges we had was trying to</p>
<p>automatically grade those work orders</p>
<p>yes we can is it a good thing typically</p>
<p>not until you really trust information</p>
<p>you fine-tune your models and you know</p>
<p>that they're working well so that's how</p>
<p>we how we handle false positive alarms</p>
<p>and there they are are different ways of</p>
<p>also doing it or discovering that</p>
<p>through some IR technology that we're</p>
<p>using it or digital twins for machine</p>
<p>manufactory manufacturers possible</p>
<p>absolutely so if you and we are actually</p>
<p>working with machine manufacturers that</p>
<p>make really interesting components in</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>actually have IOT capability now built</p>
<p>into the component I deployed tens of</p>
<p>thousands of this and that information</p>
<p>gets fed and they are selling the hard</p>
<p>way with the software that the remote</p>
<p>monitoring event one for their software</p>
<p>so yeah</p>
<p>in terms of of doing this for actual</p>
<p>machine manufacturers absolutely and</p>
<p>there are different OEMs that use our</p>
<p>software to create solutions for their</p>
<p>hard way which they ship with the</p>
<p>software great question on how do you</p>
<p>how do you work with real time data and</p>
<p>this probably the last question that we</p>
<p>have time for if there are any more just</p>
<p>please send them on and we'll get back</p>
<p>to you but you mentioned that your</p>
<p>platform works on real time data how do</p>
<p>you capture these data points in real</p>
<p>time like in the mining example they</p>
<p>might be network issues or data points</p>
<p>what I didn't explain and apologies for</p>
<p>that again there's a separate video on</p>
<p>how there's in more detail and around</p>
<p>the data streams is that that data</p>
<p>stream could actually be deployed oh</p>
<p>sorry distributed across multiple</p>
<p>environments it could be a hybrid that</p>
<p>you might do some of the initial data</p>
<p>acquisition on-premise or at the edge</p>
<p>depending on you know what what term you</p>
<p>use for that and that you might do some</p>
<p>of the pre-processing there it may white</p>
<p>if there's network of connectivity</p>
<p>issues and send some of the data which</p>
<p>you then analyze for that this could</p>
<p>also be deployed on-premise so it</p>
<p>doesn't it's not necessarily cloud by</p>
<p>solution it is it could be deployed</p>
<p>on-premise it could be deployed in the</p>
<p>cloud or it could be deployed as a</p>
<p>hybrid to deal with network connectivity</p>
<p>and that example that I showed where the</p>
<p>partner created the solution around the</p>
<p>blast furnace they actually have</p>
<p>connectivity issues so we had to in the</p>
<p>header history Mike provision for how do</p>
<p>we get data in when we when we actually</p>
<p>don't have network capability and that's</p>
<p>through edge device and doing that part</p>
<p>of it so great question thank you for</p>
<p>that so hopefully this has been been</p>
<p>have been helpful in in sort of giving</p>
<p>you overview on why digital twins are</p>
<p>the most productive remote worker that</p>
<p>you can hire just make sure that you</p>
<p>hire it for for the right reasons and</p>
<p>how you can apply this technology to</p>
<p>have a massive impact and as we move</p>
<p>from the control room to the bedroom</p>
<p>thank you for your time really</p>
<p>appreciate this and we'll see you on one</p>
<p>of our future webinars</p>
