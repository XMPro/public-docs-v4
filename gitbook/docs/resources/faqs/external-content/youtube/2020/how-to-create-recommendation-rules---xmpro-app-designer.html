<summary>Transcript</summary>hi in this video we're going to continue
<p>with our new recommendation what we're</p>
<p>going to focus on here is how do we add</p>
<p>rules I'll explain a bit about the</p>
<p>execution order and why it's important</p>
<p>as well as the auto escalate before we</p>
<p>jump into that in the solution</p>
<p>development process which area are we</p>
<p>focusing of the three right now we're</p>
<p>focusing on number two the</p>
<p>recommendation creation and the rules</p>
<p>the Assumption here is that you've</p>
<p>already gone through the number one</p>
<p>you've already got some data sources</p>
<p>that have been created and you're ready</p>
<p>to create some of the recommendations in</p>
<p>the rules it's jump into the software so</p>
<p>this is the app designer where we're</p>
<p>going to go to is on the Left we're</p>
<p>gonna go to recommendations and then top</p>
<p>right we're going to open manage</p>
<p>recommendations this will open a list of</p>
<p>all the recommendations that have been</p>
<p>created if we open the one that we've</p>
<p>created previously which would be the</p>
<p>temperature threshold you'll notice that</p>
<p>it is still blank what we want to do</p>
<p>here is we want to add some rules to</p>
<p>this particular recommendation to do</p>
<p>that we click the + what that'll do is</p>
<p>it'll open up a new blade for us on the</p>
<p>right which will allow us to now</p>
<p>configure the recommendation rules the</p>
<p>first one is to give it a rule name the</p>
<p>second is a headline and in a</p>
<p>description now where these all get used</p>
<p>is the rule name gets used when you are</p>
<p>actually within a data stream and you</p>
<p>want to do something with</p>
<p>recommendations read them out see which</p>
<p>ones have been closed not closed so it's</p>
<p>very important to to make sure that</p>
<p>their name implies what the rule is</p>
<p>actually doing I've got a few examples</p>
<p>I'll show you what I mean by when we</p>
<p>when we get there the headline is what</p>
<p>will appear at the top of the</p>
<p>recommendation and in the description is</p>
<p>what will appear in the description of</p>
<p>the actual recommendation where do these</p>
<p>two appear if I go to a list of</p>
<p>recommendations I already have and I</p>
<p>just open one up you'll see here is the</p>
<p>title and here is the description if we</p>
<p>drill into the recommendation across the</p>
<p>top</p>
<p>you will see the title and again you</p>
<p>will see the description so this is</p>
<p>where it will appear and the last area</p>
<p>that it will appear is if I go into a</p>
<p>particular event board you will see</p>
<p>across the top you will have the title</p>
<p>and then underneath it you will have the</p>
<p>description as well so again when you're</p>
<p>configuring your recommendations with</p>
<p>regards to their name their titles make</p>
<p>sure they are something in end-user can</p>
<p>actually relate to and explain what it</p>
<p>is that the rule is addressing a bit</p>
<p>further down we have notification</p>
<p>ranking so you can rank your specific</p>
<p>notification for this rule is it a low</p>
<p>medium or high all that this does is</p>
<p>affect how it appears when you see your</p>
<p>recommendations on the event board side</p>
<p>you can give it a specific icon and you</p>
<p>can start going through some of the</p>
<p>other details here we will follow in a</p>
<p>lot more detail some of the specific</p>
<p>items in here this is more just to give</p>
<p>you an idea of how do I create a new</p>
<p>rule to click the plus and it'll bring</p>
<p>up the rule once you fold everything in</p>
<p>you can click Save and the new rule</p>
<p>appear if I open up an existing rule</p>
<p>that we have already configured what</p>
<p>you'll see here is this is for discharge</p>
<p>pressure and if I click it you'll see I</p>
<p>have two rules that has been specified</p>
<p>for this particular recommendation I</p>
<p>have my name I have my headline and I</p>
<p>have my description the name I can very</p>
<p>quickly see what the rule is actually</p>
<p>about that's one naming your rules is</p>
<p>very important</p>
<p>this is ranked as a high if I click the</p>
<p>out of optimum range you'll see that as</p>
<p>ranked as a medium and what the numbers</p>
<p>actually mean here is you'll see I've</p>
<p>enabled execution order across the top</p>
<p>so what execution order allows me to do</p>
<p>is I can actually run these rules in a</p>
<p>sequence what that means is the first</p>
<p>rule will evaluate if it evaluates to</p>
<p>false it moves on to the second the</p>
<p>second value waits to false it moves on</p>
<p>to the</p>
<p>and so it continues down as many roles</p>
<p>as you've got configured if I was to</p>
<p>untag that you will see both my rules</p>
<p>are available but I don't have numbering</p>
<p>attached to them what this means is as</p>
<p>soon as this recommendation is triggered</p>
<p>both of these rules are going to execute</p>
<p>it exactly the same time if both of them</p>
<p>evaluate to true you are going to get</p>
<p>two recommendations there may be a</p>
<p>scenario when you need to do that if</p>
<p>however your rules need to be very</p>
<p>structured you can use the execution</p>
<p>order for those what you'll notice is I</p>
<p>don't have auto escalate ticked here as</p>
<p>well so what auto escalate does is let's</p>
<p>say you have a scenario where your</p>
<p>second rule which in this instance would</p>
<p>be my my medium ranking one was actually</p>
<p>triggered so there is a current pending</p>
<p>recommendation for this if the data</p>
<p>comes through and your first rule holds</p>
<p>true what the auto escalate will do is</p>
<p>it will close out the first and it will</p>
<p>escalate the rule to the next one so</p>
<p>auto escalate allows you to only have</p>
<p>one recommendation available at a time</p>
<p>for in this instance discharge pressure</p>
<p>if you were to leave it unchecked if</p>
<p>both of these evaluates it to true over</p>
<p>different time spans with different sets</p>
<p>of data you would get two</p>
<p>recommendations coming through as well</p>
<p>so what do we have a look at today in a</p>
<p>prior video we created a new</p>
<p>recommendation so how did we actually do</p>
<p>that here we went through how do I add</p>
<p>new rules to a recommendation and we</p>
<p>also briefly touched on how do I go</p>
<p>through the auto escalate and the</p>
<p>execution order for a particular role as</p>
<p>well</p>
