<details>
<summary>Transcript</summary>welcome to another training video from
<p>Excel pro in this video we will be</p>
<p>looking at how to manage agents in</p>
<p>downstream designer and all the IP</p>
<p>functions that go with it</p>
<p>so when you log on to - string designer</p>
<p>you will notice that on the left side</p>
<p>here in the menu there is an option for</p>
<p>agents since agent management is related</p>
<p>to IT your admin may or may not have</p>
<p>given you access to this but provided</p>
<p>you have access he will give to click on</p>
<p>it and then look at this list where you</p>
<p>will see all the agents that are</p>
<p>uploaded or added to your company they</p>
<p>will be grouped by their types as you</p>
<p>can see over here I have agents grouped</p>
<p>into action agents machine-learning</p>
<p>compass provide context providers</p>
<p>functions etc you can overhear drill</p>
<p>down into a certain agent and look at</p>
<p>its name description type etcetera most</p>
<p>of these properties here will be</p>
<p>read-only as they are controlled by the</p>
<p>package that you upload however you can</p>
<p>still come in and change certain items</p>
<p>like category if you need to you can</p>
<p>also add some tags like or database etc</p>
<p>and lastly you will notice that there is</p>
<p>a version history coming up where you</p>
<p>can see which version was uploaded when</p>
<p>and along with that you can also see a</p>
<p>bit of account that basically tells you</p>
<p>where this agent is being used and at</p>
<p>how many of the use cases it is being</p>
<p>used at so at the moment I have one use</p>
<p>case who was using this agent particular</p>
<p>version</p>
<p>an important point to note is that this</p>
<p>count is gone only going to be for the</p>
<p>use cases you have access to if other</p>
<p>users in your company are using agent</p>
<p>email have those counts reflected here</p>
<p>because we don't have access to those</p>
<p>use cases to process your changes you</p>
<p>can simply click on save and then close</p>
<p>the little done next if you want to</p>
<p>upload a new version of an agent you can</p>
<p>do so by clicking the Add button and</p>
<p>then over here uploading the package</p>
<p>which you would have received from</p>
<p>XM Pro or your administrator if I do</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>it is going to upload the fault and then</p>
<p>give me certain options in terms of</p>
<p>explaining what the agent is and what</p>
<p>the subscription might be and then</p>
<p>lastly I can choose what is another</p>
<p>category that if it must go in and if I</p>
<p>save it that will then be added as a new</p>
<p>version on top of the existing ones as</p>
<p>you can see now if I need to delete</p>
<p>certain versions I can do that by</p>
<p>clicking on the delete versions button</p>
<p>over here and I can either choose a</p>
<p>certain version or choose all of them</p>
<p>and to be deleted however if the system</p>
<p>will not let you delete a version which</p>
<p>is being used by you or any other user</p>
<p>in your company if you want to bulk the</p>
<p>beat or manage your agents over here you</p>
<p>can select this checkbox option here and</p>
<p>that will then display check boxes over</p>
<p>here which will then allow you to select</p>
<p>multiple agents and then delete them</p>
<p>altogether</p>
<p>lastly a bit of advanced function is</p>
<p>that if you want to upload bulk in bulk</p>
<p>your agents so maybe you're setting up</p>
<p>the site fresh and you will upload all</p>
<p>of them together so you can upload a zip</p>
<p>file which which can be simply as file</p>
<p>which contains multiple of those XMP</p>
<p>falls as you can see over here and if I</p>
<p>upload that it will give me the option</p>
<p>for each agent to choose which category</p>
<p>it should end up in once I do that I can</p>
<p>then upload all of them in one go so</p>
<p>that's how you manage a agents in that</p>
<p>string designer</p>
<p>thank you so much for watching</p>
