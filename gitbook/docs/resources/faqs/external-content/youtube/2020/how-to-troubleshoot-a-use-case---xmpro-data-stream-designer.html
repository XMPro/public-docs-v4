<summary>Transcript</summary>welcome to another training video from
<p>ex and grow in this video we will look</p>
<p>at how to troubleshoot a use case in</p>
<p>data streaming design so I have a very</p>
<p>simple use case here I'm just simulating</p>
<p>some data and then I've configured a</p>
<p>sequel writer where I want to write that</p>
<p>data into a sequel table there there is</p>
<p>a chance that something may not be</p>
<p>working as I expected and I may have to</p>
<p>find out more information around the why</p>
<p>it is not behaving as I wanted it to</p>
<p>there are a few options available to you</p>
<p>which you can use to couple suit your</p>
<p>use case so if I publish this use case</p>
<p>the first thing I can do if I have an</p>
<p>indication that it is not working</p>
<p>properly is to try it and look into the</p>
<p>live view so the live view gives you</p>
<p>this opportunity to look at each one of</p>
<p>these agents and see if one of them is</p>
<p>not producing data in this case as you</p>
<p>can see the data is being produced by</p>
<p>the top agent but it is somehow not</p>
<p>being output outputted by the the</p>
<p>database agent here as that one is empty</p>
<p>so that tells me that something is going</p>
<p>wrong in this agent now in order to find</p>
<p>that out once we have established the</p>
<p>the point where the problem is what we</p>
<p>can do is we can look at this error</p>
<p>endpoint which was explained in the</p>
<p>video on air endpoints so I'll quickly</p>
<p>just put an even printer here even</p>
<p>printer is an agent which doesn't do</p>
<p>anything with the data except that it</p>
<p>gives you sort of a point where you can</p>
<p>take a snapshot of the data in your</p>
<p>string of what's passing through so now</p>
<p>if I publish this and I go to the live</p>
<p>view and I look at my Eamon printer I</p>
<p>might get some error messages as you can</p>
<p>see over there so I I can see what is</p>
<p>going wrong with my agent and it is</p>
<p>telling me why it's Aaron</p>
<p>point that the priority is being</p>
<p>violated and said can't insert those</p>
<p>records and that's why it is failing to</p>
<p>process them and each point is also</p>
<p>being shown over here so another</p>
<p>scenario might be that you are trying to</p>
<p>troubleshoot your use case but you see</p>
<p>no data at all none of the aliens are</p>
<p>showing any data in live view however</p>
<p>your use case is published well one</p>
<p>thing we can try is that we go to the</p>
<p>collection where this music is supposed</p>
<p>to be running and look at the stream</p>
<p>host where there will be some logs and</p>
<p>they can give us an indication why</p>
<p>something might not be working as you</p>
<p>can see over here I have an error</p>
<p>message saying that the stream was</p>
<p>actually failed to start the stream and</p>
<p>the reason was that the object which is</p>
<p>supposed to log to the database faulted</p>
<p>on startup because it could not find a</p>
<p>certain table in the database which it</p>
<p>was supposed to write to hence the</p>
<p>stream did not start at all and you can</p>
<p>see that in the logs over here so that</p>
<p>gives you further information about why</p>
<p>you may not be seeing any data in your</p>
<p>use case along with that you can also</p>
<p>see that anything that ended up on the</p>
<p>air endpoint that we looked at before</p>
<p>also ends up over here in your logs and</p>
<p>you can and you can go through them and</p>
<p>the last scenario could be that your</p>
<p>stream of is just not online at all and</p>
<p>in that case what you may have to do is</p>
<p>look at where the stream host was</p>
<p>installed and in the installation folder</p>
<p>you will see that there will be a folder</p>
<p>called blogs you can go in there and</p>
<p>look for those logs directly on the file</p>
<p>system and try to find out why that</p>
<p>string was it's not starting or not</p>
<p>connecting to the server maybe there is</p>
<p>some connectivity issue</p>
<p>a key or the password has expired so</p>
<p>those are some of the options you can</p>
<p>use to troubleshoot your use case thank</p>
<p>you so much for watching</p>
