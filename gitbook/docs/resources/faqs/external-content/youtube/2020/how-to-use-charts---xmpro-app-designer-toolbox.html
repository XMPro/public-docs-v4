<details>
<summary>Transcript</summary>welcome to another training video from
<p>XM pro today we will be looking at the</p>
<p>chart control and how to use it in app</p>
<p>designer it is one of the most used</p>
<p>controls in app designer if you want to</p>
<p>use it you can simply search for it in</p>
<p>the toolbox and under basic you will</p>
<p>find a controller called chart you can</p>
<p>drag it to the place where you want to</p>
<p>add it and then if you save your app you</p>
<p>will see that you have an empty chart</p>
<p>already now in order to display some</p>
<p>data inside we will see how we can</p>
<p>configure this child so I'll click on</p>
<p>the chart and in the block properties I</p>
<p>have a few options to configure starting</p>
<p>with the appearance - source and data</p>
<p>before we go into appearance let's give</p>
<p>it some data so that we can see how it</p>
<p>looks so in the data source I have a few</p>
<p>page data options that are that are</p>
<p>available to me I will choose the sense</p>
<p>of values 1 and then the next step that</p>
<p>I need to do is even though I have</p>
<p>assigned a data source to my chart it</p>
<p>will still not do anything because it</p>
<p>has not been configured for any series</p>
<p>in order to add a series to the chart I</p>
<p>have to come to the data item accordion</p>
<p>item here and in sees I have to click +</p>
<p>when I do that you will notice that I</p>
<p>have a few options starting with the</p>
<p>name what I want to call the series for</p>
<p>example let's say I wanna say</p>
<p>temperature then I can give it some</p>
<p>color</p>
<p>for example this and then I have an</p>
<p>option to choose among different type of</p>
<p>charts which which series type I want so</p>
<p>for this example I'll choose bar bar</p>
<p>type</p>
<p>next I have to provide my x-axis and</p>
<p>y-axis values so in this case I'll say</p>
<p>IB is my x-axis and y-axis I have a</p>
<p>value coming and I'm called X I will</p>
<p>also choose some of these options so</p>
<p>that we can see how they look we have an</p>
<p>option for show labels and we will just</p>
<p>see what that means in a minute show</p>
<p>points is also there which will which</p>
<p>I'll explain when we create a line line</p>
<p>type series lastly we have ignored empty</p>
<p>points which basically says that if a</p>
<p>point does not have a value it should</p>
<p>not be displayed rather than displaying</p>
<p>empty space for it so now that I have a</p>
<p>series I'll save this and we can reload</p>
<p>the chart on this side and you'll see</p>
<p>that the data has come through we chose</p>
<p>that color and we chose the bar series</p>
<p>you can see the box here is here with my</p>
<p>legend and since we chose the option to</p>
<p>to show labels we can see that each bar</p>
<p>has a label on it now let's jump into</p>
<p>the appearance options first of all I</p>
<p>have a rotated option which if I choose</p>
<p>will change or switch my X and y-axis</p>
<p>like that next we will see that for</p>
<p>x-axis I have certain options here</p>
<p>specifically that that excess line what</p>
<p>color should it have and I can specify</p>
<p>that color over there I can also choose</p>
<p>should that X's have gridlines and we'll</p>
<p>just see how they look like and if I</p>
<p>want gridlines like I can also choose a</p>
<p>color for them show labels basically say</p>
<p>is if these labels should be displayed</p>
<p>or not and if you want to choose a color</p>
<p>for those labels you can also do that</p>
<p>lastly we have a value margins enabled I</p>
<p>will enable that this time and you will</p>
<p>notice that this time these bars will</p>
<p>not</p>
<p>start at the very end of the Lexus so</p>
<p>let's save that much and refresh here</p>
<p>and you can see that my labels are gone</p>
<p>gridlines have come in and the bar is</p>
<p>there's a slight different distance</p>
<p>between the bar and X's this becomes</p>
<p>more visible if you're using charge like</p>
<p>line chart so let's let's continue and</p>
<p>add a few more options in y-axis we have</p>
<p>more or less similar stuff and we can</p>
<p>choose access color line color which is</p>
<p>this line you can choose if it should</p>
<p>display grid lines if you choose they</p>
<p>will see that there will be grid lines</p>
<p>going vertically over here again we have</p>
<p>color to choose for the grid line and if</p>
<p>we want to show these labels or not we</p>
<p>can also for the y-axis choose a minimum</p>
<p>and maximum value the chart will</p>
<p>automatically try to adapt with the</p>
<p>maximum value it finds and display you</p>
<p>the y-axis accordingly but if you want</p>
<p>to have a static value for it for</p>
<p>example I want my chart to always be</p>
<p>range from 0 to 150 I can do that by</p>
<p>choosing that and a very very related</p>
<p>option to that is how much how big of a</p>
<p>jump each step should have on this X's</p>
<p>as of now you can see there is a ten</p>
<p>point jump between each interval I can</p>
<p>change that and choose for example 30</p>
<p>lastly around the legend I can choose if</p>
<p>it should be visible or not and also</p>
<p>where on the chart should be displayed</p>
<p>if I change it to display at the at the</p>
<p>bottom center you will see that it will</p>
<p>move over there the legend has come come</p>
<p>across over here and we also change our</p>
<p>range on the y axis and you can see it</p>
<p>is now going from 0 to 150 in each</p>
<p>interval as of 30 now so those are some</p>
<p>of the appearance options on the</p>
<p>now chart can display more than one</p>
<p>series and you can choose different</p>
<p>combination of series we added a bar</p>
<p>type series here let's go ahead and try</p>
<p>to add another series which will be</p>
<p>let's say line line chart we can call it</p>
<p>pressure you can give it some color this</p>
<p>time we'll choose the line will keep the</p>
<p>same x-axis will change the value for</p>
<p>the y-axis now again I can choose labels</p>
<p>which will display labels like that for</p>
<p>each point points I will just show you</p>
<p>what means no empty points is same as</p>
<p>before now if I save and refresh on this</p>
<p>side we expect to see two items in our</p>
<p>chart which is a bar chart and also the</p>
<p>line C is going across which you can see</p>
<p>we chose show points and that points are</p>
<p>these go around circles so that is how</p>
<p>you use a chart control in app designer</p>
<p>thank you so much for watching</p>
