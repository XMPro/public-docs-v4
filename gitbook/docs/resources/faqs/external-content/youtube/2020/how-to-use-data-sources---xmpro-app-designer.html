<summary>Transcript</summary>welcome to another training video from
<p>accent growth today we will be looking</p>
<p>at how to create and use their sources</p>
<p>as a prerequisite you should have</p>
<p>already gone through the video on how to</p>
<p>create AB direct connections if you</p>
<p>haven't I highly recommend you do that</p>
<p>first let's just let's let's jump in so</p>
<p>I have an app here as you can see</p>
<p>budgets all blanket and I wanted to</p>
<p>display some data so the first thing I</p>
<p>would like to do is over here where you</p>
<p>see page data I would like to add some</p>
<p>data sources so if I click plus over</p>
<p>there it will give me this screen where</p>
<p>I have to specify a name for my data</p>
<p>source let's say I say it means furnace</p>
<p>health store then I can choose a</p>
<p>connection as for the last video we</p>
<p>created a connection and call it first</p>
<p>and I will choose that and that will</p>
<p>bring back all the entities that that</p>
<p>connection can provide me the entity I</p>
<p>am looking for is called</p>
<p>furnace tab once that part is done I can</p>
<p>click Save and then that data source</p>
<p>will be available for me to use in my</p>
<p>page I can reuse it as many times as I</p>
<p>like on this page clicking the expand</p>
<p>button here shows me all the columns or</p>
<p>attributes that are being returned by</p>
<p>the data source now how do I put it on</p>
<p>my phone or on my screen there are a</p>
<p>couple of controls here which are</p>
<p>actually their amount controls for</p>
<p>example a chart or a grid or a drop-down</p>
<p>these are all the controls which can be</p>
<p>bound to an air source and they will</p>
<p>behave accordingly so let's start with</p>
<p>one control which is the easiest and</p>
<p>that is</p>
<p>director and I will go to better over</p>
<p>there click on it and let's say I want</p>
<p>my furnace data to appear in this</p>
<p>directed I will then go to the block</p>
<p>properties and you will see I have a few</p>
<p>options here from the static rent I'll</p>
<p>go I'll skip the others and just go to</p>
<p>the data source which will then present</p>
<p>me in the screen the first thing it asks</p>
<p>me is which tell source I want to use so</p>
<p>I'll use the one I just created and then</p>
<p>I have an option to either create a</p>
<p>filter on it select if I want the data</p>
<p>to be sorted by a certain column there</p>
<p>are also some advanced options but I'll</p>
<p>leave all of them for default I'll click</p>
<p>Save and when I launch it I expect to</p>
<p>see data in the data grid which is</p>
<p>coming from my data source as you can</p>
<p>see it loaded that up now let's go back</p>
<p>and try a few other controls and see</p>
<p>what are the other options to present</p>
<p>data on the screen so let's try and put</p>
<p>a chart in this area so I put a chart</p>
<p>over there and when I click on it I can</p>
<p>go to its block properties and under</p>
<p>data source again I'll choose the same</p>
<p>data source and then very quickly I'll</p>
<p>go and add a series where the pipe movie</p>
<p>line perhaps let's say bar chart I will</p>
<p>choose X X to be the asset ID and the</p>
<p>y-axis to be health score I'm not going</p>
<p>to go into much detail of this because</p>
<p>this will be covered in the chart how to</p>
<p>use a chart control video on song</p>
<p>anywhere but once I apply and save I can</p>
<p>launch the app again and my daughter</p>
<p>should appear both in the chart and the</p>
<p>grid</p>
<p>now one last things</p>
<p>these are the controls which know how to</p>
<p>display the data source they have their</p>
<p>own way of Miss playing each record that</p>
<p>they receive from your data source the</p>
<p>data grid knows how to display it in</p>
<p>certain lines chart knows how to put it</p>
<p>as bars but what if I don't want to</p>
<p>stick to how these controls are present</p>
<p>there I want to create something on my</p>
<p>own if that is the case what you can do</p>
<p>is you can use a control called data</p>
<p>repeater box I will drag it over here</p>
<p>once it is dried I'm gonna expands the</p>
<p>whole area by default I'm gonna give it</p>
<p>a smaller height for example 70 pixels</p>
<p>now what I want to do is for each record</p>
<p>that might a social dance I want to</p>
<p>define how it should look like on the</p>
<p>screen this data repeater box will allow</p>
<p>me to do that by specifying what Dell</p>
<p>source introduced which will be the same</p>
<p>one much like moths that you set and</p>
<p>save it</p>
<p>this box is then gonna going to repeat</p>
<p>itself for every row it's gonna find in</p>
<p>that data source and now I have the</p>
<p>opportunity to define how each line</p>
<p>should look some that is it's done from</p>
<p>the data source so I'll go ahead and</p>
<p>create a bit of a template here for my</p>
<p>data items so in the blocks I'll put a</p>
<p>vertical stack layer I'm gonna quickly</p>
<p>make it so that and then I'm gonna put a</p>
<p>text in it and next I'm gonna put text</p>
<p>again actually I should since I had some</p>
<p>styles are in fashion just long this is</p>
<p>quite depth if you</p>
<p>use your existing styles you can just</p>
<p>clone them don't have to stop every box</p>
<p>again and again now in the last box</p>
<p>let's say I wanna put an indicator right</p>
<p>so I have that layout that layout is</p>
<p>going to repeat itself for every line</p>
<p>that it receives from the data source</p>
<p>now but I want this text will actually</p>
<p>display the text coming from my data</p>
<p>source so I can go to the block</p>
<p>properties and in the appearance change</p>
<p>this text from static to a dynamic value</p>
<p>and then it will give me all the options</p>
<p>that I have in my repeater box so I'll</p>
<p>choose the name to be displayed over</p>
<p>there and for this one I will choose the</p>
<p>health score and for the last one I will</p>
<p>go ahead and choose its color to be</p>
<p>dynamically set by what is being</p>
<p>received as status from the terror</p>
<p>source once I saved this and launched it</p>
<p>I expect to see a lying over here or my</p>
<p>repeater to repeat for every record that</p>
<p>it forms and we can see it is showing</p>
<p>that the template ID I created is being</p>
<p>repeated for every okay and that's how</p>
<p>you choose yourself how each item in</p>
<p>your - source should be represented or</p>
<p>displayed on the screen so that was a</p>
<p>video on how to use the sources and bind</p>
<p>them to certain controls</p>
<p>thank you so much</p>
