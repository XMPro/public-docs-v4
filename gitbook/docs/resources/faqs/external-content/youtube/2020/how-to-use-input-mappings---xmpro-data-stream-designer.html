<details>
<summary>Transcript</summary>welcome to another training video from
<p>Exim pro today we will be looking at</p>
<p>input mappings what they are and how to</p>
<p>use them interesting designer so what</p>
<p>our infant mappings infant mapping is</p>
<p>the way an agent uses to define the sort</p>
<p>of inputs it would it would like to</p>
<p>receive one once an agent has defined</p>
<p>that structure of payload or input that</p>
<p>it acquires they need to be mapped and</p>
<p>that is where infant mappings come in</p>
<p>mostly you would notice that action</p>
<p>agents would have input mappings on them</p>
<p>first of all the documentation of the</p>
<p>agent would explain them but you can</p>
<p>also click on the arrow that is leading</p>
<p>into an agent and you will notice that</p>
<p>this configure button with will get</p>
<p>enables whenever that agent requires</p>
<p>input mappings so how do you configure</p>
<p>them you can either double click on the</p>
<p>arrow or you can click the configure</p>
<p>button after you have selected the arrow</p>
<p>and you will notice that the screen will</p>
<p>show up you can maximize it to work with</p>
<p>the screen and over here you will see</p>
<p>there are two sides right hand side</p>
<p>basically lists all the inputs that this</p>
<p>agent is expecting on the left hand side</p>
<p>you would see all the properties that</p>
<p>your preceding agent is sending its</p>
<p>sending in and you can then go ahead and</p>
<p>map them to map them you simply select</p>
<p>the option from the drop-down and then</p>
<p>the mapping is done and then you can</p>
<p>save by clicking on the apply and then</p>
<p>save your use case for them to persist</p>
<p>now if you look at some of the advanced</p>
<p>options in there you would notice that</p>
<p>across the top over there you have a few</p>
<p>options first of all we have an option</p>
<p>to say let's say if you want to filter</p>
<p>this list and to only show the ones</p>
<p>which are unmet so you can click on that</p>
<p>and you'll see they know that only the</p>
<p>unmapped rows are not visible this is</p>
<p>very useful if you had a big list let's</p>
<p>say this agent was</p>
<p>hundred or more inputs then and there is</p>
<p>only one that is unmapped so finding</p>
<p>that through a big list would have been</p>
<p>a problem and that's where you can use</p>
<p>this filter next we would notice that we</p>
<p>also have an automatic feature which</p>
<p>basically if you click on it would try</p>
<p>and find if there are any direct matches</p>
<p>it can automatically do for example it</p>
<p>found that on the left hand side it has</p>
<p>an option coming in called time stamp</p>
<p>and on the right side the same option is</p>
<p>being expected so it would automatically</p>
<p>make that mapping you would also notice</p>
<p>here that some of the options are</p>
<p>automatically disabled they are disabled</p>
<p>because the ton of those items don't</p>
<p>match the input that is being asked over</p>
<p>here a handy tip here would be if you</p>
<p>want to map something and the type</p>
<p>doesn't match you can simply go ahead</p>
<p>and drag data conversion transformation</p>
<p>which will let you convert the data type</p>
<p>of your attribute and then you will be</p>
<p>able to map them getting back to the top</p>
<p>bit over here you will see we have</p>
<p>another option which says match my</p>
<p>expression starting with the prefix</p>
<p>option where you choose what the prefix</p>
<p>should be so what that will do is let's</p>
<p>say I say device underscore is my prefix</p>
<p>and I click OK it will go ahead and try</p>
<p>to find items which match if that prefix</p>
<p>is added to the right hand side so it</p>
<p>went ahead and found device underscore</p>
<p>pressure would match pressure and it has</p>
<p>put that in again these are the things</p>
<p>which would help if you had a mess of</p>
<p>this list here similarly we have options</p>
<p>for postfix where you can type in the</p>
<p>postfix and it will do rest of the</p>
<p>mething for example I can do that and</p>
<p>you'll say and you'll see it has done</p>
<p>vibration underscore current to the</p>
<p>vibration and lastly and we have an</p>
<p>expression option where you can define</p>
<p>an expression for example if I want</p>
<p>let's say device underscore and wherever</p>
<p>you want to substitute the right-hand</p>
<p>side you would put dollar 1/4 for that</p>
<p>expression and then you can type in the</p>
<p>rest of your expression so what this</p>
<p>will do is it will try to match any</p>
<p>property coming in which is device</p>
<p>underscore name of the right-hand side</p>
<p>which is expected underscore change you</p>
<p>will notice that it has mapped it has</p>
<p>mapped device underscore temperature</p>
<p>underscore change to temperature here so</p>
<p>those are some of the advanced options</p>
<p>here and that is basically how you use</p>
<p>input mappings I hope this was helpful</p>
<p>thank you so much for watching</p>
