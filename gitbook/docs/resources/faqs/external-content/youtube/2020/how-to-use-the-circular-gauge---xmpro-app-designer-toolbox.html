<summary>Transcript</summary>welcome to another training video from
<p>ex and pro today we will be looking at</p>
<p>circular Gage and how to use it in app</p>
<p>designer so let's jump into it over here</p>
<p>you can see I have already created a</p>
<p>page in my app and to use the circular</p>
<p>gage all you need to do is basically</p>
<p>find it in the toolbox</p>
<p>it's called circular Gage under basic</p>
<p>and you just drag it into the box where</p>
<p>you want it to show so without making</p>
<p>any change we can see but what it looks</p>
<p>like and that's basically what it would</p>
<p>look like as default you can see it has</p>
<p>a range on the outside circle which is</p>
<p>going from 0 to 200 and then you is</p>
<p>pointing to a value currently sitting at</p>
<p>55 now let's say we want to change a few</p>
<p>things here</p>
<p>starting with let's say the title of the</p>
<p>gage so what I can do is that I can</p>
<p>click on my gage go to its properties</p>
<p>and in appearance I have a few options</p>
<p>starting with of course the title which</p>
<p>I can change and perhaps call it else go</p>
<p>next you will see I have options to</p>
<p>change the font both of the title and</p>
<p>the numbers on my range and that is done</p>
<p>over here similar you have options to</p>
<p>change the tick interval maybe I want it</p>
<p>to be just 1 that interval is basically</p>
<p>what you see over here from 0 to 10</p>
<p>there there the step 10 and from 10 to</p>
<p>20 there is another step of 10 so you</p>
<p>can define what size of these individual</p>
<p>steps should be on your range</p>
<p>and then if we go to behavior you will</p>
<p>see it has a range and and we can</p>
<p>specify where it should start and finish</p>
<p>so right now it is starting at zero and</p>
<p>finishing at hundred but we can change</p>
<p>that for example I can change it to be</p>
<p>from zero to ten and the last thing is</p>
<p>the value itself you can see it right</p>
<p>now has a static value of 55 and I can</p>
<p>change that for example to eight just to</p>
<p>demonstrate now if I save it and we just</p>
<p>refresh this bit in place you will see</p>
<p>that we now have a range of zero to ten</p>
<p>the step individual steps are of one and</p>
<p>my current value is at eight of course</p>
<p>the title has also changed now at the</p>
<p>second step let's say we want this gauge</p>
<p>to read a dynamic value from our data</p>
<p>source as you can see currently I</p>
<p>specified in a static value if you want</p>
<p>a dynamic value you have to put it</p>
<p>inside a control which allows a data</p>
<p>source for example a data repeater which</p>
<p>you'll find over here or a box or</p>
<p>similar other controls which have data</p>
<p>source options I have already created a</p>
<p>data repeater here and it has a data</p>
<p>source which is currently pointing to</p>
<p>furnace telemetry that I have configured</p>
<p>in the background now if I drag the</p>
<p>circular gauge into this box and I go to</p>
<p>its value option</p>
<p>and I say that I do not want the static</p>
<p>value but I want a dynamic one by</p>
<p>clicking there you'll see I have all the</p>
<p>columns that are being sent by my dad</p>
<p>and my dad source and I can pick the one</p>
<p>that I want for example health score now</p>
<p>if I save it and refresh it on this side</p>
<p>you will see that the second gauge has</p>
<p>appeared over here it has a range of 0</p>
<p>200 but this time it's reading its value</p>
<p>from the data source which was 80 one</p>
<p>last item to look at is how some values</p>
<p>work as you can see that we are</p>
<p>currently displaying one value on our</p>
<p>range but you can display more than one</p>
<p>values and to do that you click on your</p>
<p>gauge go to its value option and you'll</p>
<p>see there are sub value options I can</p>
<p>add more values for example 5 now when I</p>
<p>will save it you will see there is</p>
<p>another value appearing so that is my</p>
<p>sub value if you want to change the look</p>
<p>and feel of this sub value you can go</p>
<p>under appearance there there's a section</p>
<p>for set values where you can choose what</p>
<p>the sub value indicator should be should</p>
<p>it be a range bar should it be a needle</p>
<p>or a few other options you can also</p>
<p>choose the color it should have and</p>
<p>there's an advanced option of an</p>
<p>indicator offset which basically says</p>
<p>how far away should this be from the</p>
<p>actual range bar so that's how you use a</p>
<p>circular gauge thank you for joining me</p>
