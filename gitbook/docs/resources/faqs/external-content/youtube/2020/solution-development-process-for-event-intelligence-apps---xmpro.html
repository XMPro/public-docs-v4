<summary>Transcript</summary>hi today what I'm going to take you
<p>through is the Excel CRO solution</p>
<p>development process how do you approach</p>
<p>and create your first event intelligence</p>
<p>application what steps do you go through</p>
<p>and why do you go through those</p>
<p>particular steps from our perspective</p>
<p>and how we address the particular</p>
<p>solution that you're trying to put</p>
<p>together is what problem are we solving</p>
<p>with this particular application so</p>
<p>what's the key problem that we're</p>
<p>looking to to address with this and that</p>
<p>will lead us into the following steps</p>
<p>that we will be going through step one</p>
<p>designing real time data streams using</p>
<p>real time data sources what we mean by</p>
<p>this is where's my information coming</p>
<p>from for me to solve a particular</p>
<p>problem I need information where's my</p>
<p>life feed coming from are we getting it</p>
<p>from a historian are we getting it from</p>
<p>a live feed or a MQTT as an example the</p>
<p>second is what type of analytics or</p>
<p>calculations are we going to do on this</p>
<p>data to help us identify some of the</p>
<p>exceptions and the errors in it that</p>
<p>we're looking for and then the third</p>
<p>we're still within the data stream</p>
<p>here's what I put formatting and what</p>
<p>type of action do we want to drive so</p>
<p>once we've identified some data that</p>
<p>matches the particular event that we're</p>
<p>looking for what action do we want to</p>
<p>drive or with that first step is data</p>
<p>streams using real time data sources</p>
<p>step two this is where we go into</p>
<p>creating some event rules some</p>
<p>recommendations and again here is what</p>
<p>is the rule logic for for this gonna</p>
<p>look like what type of thresholds do we</p>
<p>want to set how many rules do we want to</p>
<p>actually put into that the second is do</p>
<p>we want offer some work instructions so</p>
<p>if a recommendation is triggered</p>
<p>how does someone actually go about</p>
<p>resolving or reacting or responding to</p>
<p>their recommendation and in third is</p>
<p>what other resources can we provide</p>
<p>a link to a schematic heading to an</p>
<p>engineering test procedure or maybe a</p>
<p>video etc the third step is this is</p>
<p>where we create the event boards and the</p>
<p>apps themselves so here's where we lay</p>
<p>out the actual event board decide which</p>
<p>piece of information we want where but</p>
<p>again which one answer a particular</p>
<p>question by displaying this information</p>
<p>onto the screen what does it mean and</p>
<p>what are we actually showing easy access</p>
<p>to some recommendations how do I filter</p>
<p>recommendations I don't want see</p>
<p>everything I just want to see what is</p>
<p>particular to this event board that I'm</p>
<p>creating and lastly you can also create</p>
<p>some self validating kpi's in your event</p>
<p>board if you actually need to so this is</p>
<p>the the whole process step 1 step 2 and</p>
<p>step 3 so step 1 touching on data</p>
<p>streams is real-time data sources step 2</p>
<p>event rules and recommendations and then</p>
<p>step 3 creating event boards and</p>
<p>ultimately the apps as well there is</p>
<p>still change management and project and</p>
<p>IT management governance etc that flows</p>
<p>through through all three of these as</p>
<p>well so those are not forgotten so what</p>
<p>does this actually look like in practice</p>
<p>the particular problem is I'm looking</p>
<p>for a temperature condition on my pump</p>
<p>so we're monitoring for a temperature</p>
<p>condition on my pump so the first thing</p>
<p>is data sources real-time data sources</p>
<p>through a data stream so where do we</p>
<p>actually do that so we do that in the</p>
<p>data stream designer and we've got an</p>
<p>example that will come up on the screen</p>
<p>here what does that actually look like</p>
<p>so again step one where's my data coming</p>
<p>from how do I get context rank all the</p>
<p>data create some analytics particularly</p>
<p>the calculations on it if I need to</p>
<p>format it and then ultimately drive a</p>
<p>particular action so in this example</p>
<p>that we've got here as we're reading</p>
<p>real-time data in from mqtt and creating</p>
<p>context with zero sequel within</p>
<p>performing some calculation and</p>
<p>analytics in the middle and ultimately</p>
<p>on the far right this is where we are</p>
<p>outputting and integrating to output</p>
<p>systems in some subsequent videos will</p>
<p>actually go</p>
<p>through and create this particular</p>
<p>example I'm just giving a holistic view</p>
<p>here of the steps you need to go through</p>
<p>for this particular process so step one</p>
<p>is done in the data stream designer and</p>
<p>this is where we create our data streams</p>
<p>using real time data sources to make</p>
<p>this information available to</p>
<p>recommendations and to make it available</p>
<p>to the app designer as well step 2 this</p>
<p>is where we start creating some of the</p>
<p>event rules and recommendations and we</p>
<p>do this in the app designer so again if</p>
<p>we just pull up a particular example</p>
<p>here we've created a recommendation for</p>
<p>pump temperature and we just created one</p>
<p>rule for that as well so what rules and</p>
<p>thresholds do we want to actually</p>
<p>configure what recommended actions where</p>
<p>do we do that</p>
<p>and how do we actually provide</p>
<p>additional resources videos engineering</p>
<p>test procedures etc again step one is to</p>
<p>create a data stream step two is to</p>
<p>create the event rules and</p>
<p>recommendations step one is done in the</p>
<p>data stream designer step two is done in</p>
<p>the application designer and that moves</p>
<p>us on to step three step three as we</p>
<p>were creating event boards and the</p>
<p>application this is also done in the</p>
<p>application designer and if I pull an</p>
<p>example of what does that actually look</p>
<p>like here there is a full interface</p>
<p>that'll walk you through how do you</p>
<p>actually create your particular event</p>
<p>port again what's the simplest way to</p>
<p>display there's various layouts various</p>
<p>controls for you to actually use to</p>
<p>configure that how do you limit and</p>
<p>filter recommendations in this instance</p>
<p>this is on a particular pump we don't</p>
<p>want recommendations for my entire</p>
<p>assembly plant my entire production line</p>
<p>my entire facility so you can actually</p>
<p>filter that information out from here as</p>
<p>well but also if you want to how do you</p>
<p>continuously monitor health and</p>
<p>processing kpi's as well from an event</p>
<p>board perspective if I come back to to</p>
<p>where we started what problem are we</p>
<p>solving that is the thought process at</p>
<p>the behind every single step one two and</p>
<p>three as we going through it so step one</p>
<p>designing data stream</p>
<p>using real-time data sources step two we</p>
<p>creating event rules and recommendations</p>
<p>and then step three is where we touch</p>
<p>event boards and ultimately the the</p>
<p>applications step one is done in the</p>
<p>data stream designer step two is done in</p>
<p>the application designer and the same</p>
<p>with step three right at the end to</p>
<p>create your event boards thank you for</p>
<p>attending and now watching this video</p>
<p>today as I said we've just touched on</p>
<p>what is the step one two and three from</p>
<p>our perspective on how to approach</p>
<p>creating these in subsequent videos</p>
<p>we'll go into a lot more detail into</p>
<p>step one two and three</p>
