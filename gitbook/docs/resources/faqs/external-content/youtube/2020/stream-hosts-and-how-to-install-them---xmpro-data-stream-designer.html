<summary>Transcript</summary>stream hosts are an extension of the
<p>data stream designer and aware published</p>
<p>data streams are sent to run this video</p>
<p>will detail what a stream house does and</p>
<p>how to install one stream hosts are</p>
<p>external processes that can receive</p>
<p>commands from and send data to the data</p>
<p>stream server it is where data streams</p>
<p>are run when they are published and</p>
<p>where a data streams live data is sent</p>
<p>from some stream objects even need to</p>
<p>connect to the stream host in order to</p>
<p>configure themselves if no stream hosts</p>
<p>representing a collection are connected</p>
<p>to the data stream designer stream</p>
<p>objects using that collection will not</p>
<p>run nor will the live data be viewed and</p>
<p>configuration requests from certain</p>
<p>objects in that collection will fail</p>
<p>including integrity checks to install</p>
<p>the stream host navigate to any</p>
<p>collections blade and download the host</p>
<p>select the operating system you wish to</p>
<p>install it on this example will use</p>
<p>Windows and I have already downloaded a</p>
<p>stream host installer all collections</p>
<p>will let you download the same installer</p>
<p>but it is convenient to download it from</p>
<p>the collection you want the new host to</p>
<p>connect to as you will also need to</p>
<p>download the connection profile as part</p>
<p>of the installation the collection</p>
<p>profile contains all of the information</p>
<p>necessary to connect the stream host to</p>
<p>this data stream designer decrypt any</p>
<p>settings encrypted by your company's</p>
<p>encryption key and identify it as</p>
<p>belonging to this collection give your</p>
<p>device a unique name and click OK to</p>
<p>download when the installer has</p>
<p>downloaded run it the process of</p>
<p>installing will be slightly different on</p>
<p>different operating systems first agree</p>
<p>to the end-user license agreement select</p>
<p>a folder to install the stream host to</p>
<p>this example will be installed as a</p>
<p>console host meaning that it must be</p>
<p>started manually and will open a console</p>
<p>window while running the windows service</p>
<p>option would install the host as a</p>
<p>Windows service allowing it to be run</p>
<p>automatically by windows in the</p>
<p>background when prompted for a</p>
<p>connection profile select the file you</p>
<p>downloaded earlier again there may be</p>
<p>slight differences in the options based</p>
<p>on your operating system</p>
<p>we recommend browsing the documentation</p>
<p>of the installer for your operating</p>
<p>system to start a console stream host</p>
<p>search for XM pro stream host in the</p>
<p>Start menu or navigate to the folder you</p>
<p>installed it and run the program as</p>
<p>administrator this is important if you</p>
<p>installed the stream</p>
<p>an assistant folder such as program</p>
<p>files as the host will generate logs and</p>
<p>download files for agents and running</p>
<p>streams and requires the rights to save</p>
<p>these in its own folder when the stream</p>
<p>host starts it will request a list of</p>
<p>running stream objects assigned to it</p>
<p>and begin running them it will then be</p>
<p>available to send live data from those</p>
<p>stream objects and also to handle</p>
<p>requests for configuration from stream</p>
<p>objects that must be run on a host the</p>
<p>stream host may disconnect from the data</p>
<p>stream designer server due to network</p>
<p>interruption or other factors if a</p>
<p>disconnect occurs the device will no</p>
<p>longer be able to fulfill configuration</p>
<p>requests or send live data that any</p>
<p>streams that were running at the time</p>
<p>will continue to run and the device will</p>
<p>regularly attempt to re-establish a</p>
<p>connection once a connection has been</p>
<p>re-established the list of running</p>
<p>streams will be checked again any</p>
<p>streams that were unpublished while the</p>
<p>while the device was disconnected will</p>
<p>be it stopped any streams that were</p>
<p>published will begin running and any</p>
<p>streams that were unpublished updated</p>
<p>and published again will be stopped</p>
<p>updated and restarted on even</p>
<p>uninstalling the stream host is similar</p>
<p>to installing stop the stream host if it</p>
<p>is running then running the same</p>
<p>installer will give you the option to</p>
<p>uninstall if you have lost or deleted</p>
<p>the installer you can remove from the</p>
<p>add or remove programs option in your</p>
<p>operating system if all else fails it is</p>
<p>safe to delete the folder you installed</p>
<p>it to this has been a demonstration of</p>
<p>the stream host and how to install it</p>
<p>from data stream designer thank you for</p>
<p>watching</p>
