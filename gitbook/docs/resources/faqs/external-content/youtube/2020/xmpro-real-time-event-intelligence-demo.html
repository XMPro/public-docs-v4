<details>
<summary>Transcript</summary>in this demonstration I'm going to show
<p>you how to detect and respond to</p>
<p>critical events in real time without</p>
<p>having to look at data in 20 different</p>
<p>systems like you probably have to do now</p>
<p>now the XM pro event intelligent</p>
<p>platform consists of three main</p>
<p>components and the first one or the data</p>
<p>streams that you see on the Left which</p>
<p>is really aimed at connecting and</p>
<p>bringing information from those 20</p>
<p>different systems in the middle we help</p>
<p>you visualize and find those key events</p>
<p>that you are looking for that you want</p>
<p>to respond to and the last part is how</p>
<p>do you respond to those through</p>
<p>recommended actions or having act or</p>
<p>having actions and workflows in other</p>
<p>systems so let me jump in and we're</p>
<p>going to start with what you see on the</p>
<p>left the data streams and how do we</p>
<p>connect all of this information coming</p>
<p>from multiple data sources then we'll</p>
<p>move into how do we set up these</p>
<p>visualizations and in the notifications</p>
<p>that go with them because you don't look</p>
<p>at a dashboard 24 by 7 to be honest you</p>
<p>need notifications around specific</p>
<p>events that are starting to happen and</p>
<p>then how do you respond to those was</p>
<p>recommended actions so let's jump into</p>
<p>the data streams so this is the central</p>
<p>console where you can access all the</p>
<p>different modules within XM pro so the</p>
<p>app designer the data stream process</p>
<p>designer what you'll see I have</p>
<p>different instances running production</p>
<p>simulation demonstration instances so</p>
<p>I'll actually jump into the data stream</p>
<p>designer itself and this is where we set</p>
<p>up those integrations where we can</p>
<p>connect to those 20 different systems</p>
<p>get data from them and the data could be</p>
<p>real-time data from machines from</p>
<p>websites from Web Services from other</p>
<p>business applications and streaming data</p>
<p>that that could come from multiple</p>
<p>sources you can also then decide how to</p>
<p>apply some analytics to it and what</p>
<p>actions you want to drive from it you</p>
<p>can organize it into the into different</p>
<p>areas so in this instance different</p>
<p>categories are based on your business</p>
<p>structure of business organization</p>
<p>supply chains safety and this instance</p>
<p>I'm going to look at equipment</p>
<p>and I'm also just going to show you two</p>
<p>different examples the one is a very</p>
<p>basic simple example for condition</p>
<p>monitoring and the second one we are</p>
<p>adding some smarts in terms of being</p>
<p>able to predict when certain equipment</p>
<p>is going to film so let me start with</p>
<p>this simple version and in this one we</p>
<p>are just going to connect to one data</p>
<p>source in this instance the data source</p>
<p>is through OPC UA which is a protocol</p>
<p>based and we're getting temperature and</p>
<p>vibration readings for this pump we're</p>
<p>getting the make and model of the pump</p>
<p>from a different database system so this</p>
<p>is data in motion this is typically data</p>
<p>traced so this is fast moving fast</p>
<p>changing it could be thousands of</p>
<p>records per second it could be a couple</p>
<p>of records every five minutes it really</p>
<p>depends on the use case in the</p>
<p>application that you set up so in this</p>
<p>instance we're getting the vibration and</p>
<p>temperature data we we contextualize it</p>
<p>with a make and model because we want to</p>
<p>set the rule for the vibration checking</p>
<p>for that specific model and then we want</p>
<p>to start a space and work order request</p>
<p>inside external system like ASAP or</p>
<p>something in this instance we kicking</p>
<p>off a workflow inside XM pro and then we</p>
<p>would like to SMS someone that something</p>
<p>is happening so a very simple structure</p>
<p>in terms of being able to monitor</p>
<p>real-time now I can apply this model for</p>
<p>one or tens or hundreds or even</p>
<p>thousands of pumps that run the same so</p>
<p>if I've got two or three hundred slurry</p>
<p>pumps I can run the same model it's one</p>
<p>instance across all of them and it will</p>
<p>continuously look across all of them for</p>
<p>these conditions I'm trying to find</p>
<p>these events I'm trying to find when the</p>
<p>vibration is above a certain level and</p>
<p>what we have from from a the ability to</p>
<p>bring data in is something we call</p>
<p>listeners so these are all agents our</p>
<p>listening agents and this is just a</p>
<p>subset but there's a broad range of</p>
<p>listening agents so we can listen from</p>
<p>again a broad range and if we don't have</p>
<p>it it's pretty easy for us to get it</p>
<p>to our library that you see here just</p>
<p>different systems where I can get</p>
<p>real-time data streaming in or where I</p>
<p>can actually poll so if it's not a data</p>
<p>that can as a data source I can push it</p>
<p>to me I can also pull it in context data</p>
<p>this is where I make model maintenance</p>
<p>records other information that I may</p>
<p>have which may sit in something like</p>
<p>Maxima or SME or any one of those</p>
<p>systems again this is just a subset of</p>
<p>some other systems where we can get</p>
<p>contexts from so that we can certainly</p>
<p>now which bump or this temperature value</p>
<p>belongs to because the sensor typically</p>
<p>just sends the sensor ID or something</p>
<p>like that along in terms of</p>
<p>transformations this is how we</p>
<p>manipulate the data so how what do we</p>
<p>want to do with it how can we aggregate</p>
<p>how can we filter how can we join how</p>
<p>can we pass through how can we set up</p>
<p>thresholds the ones that you see there</p>
<p>all of these ability to until to</p>
<p>transform the data in one shape of form</p>
<p>in the next example I'll share a little</p>
<p>bit around the machine learning</p>
<p>capability where we just bring in some</p>
<p>machine learning but in this instance we</p>
<p>don't use it but we have standard</p>
<p>machine learning capability built-in so</p>
<p>multi-class classification regression so</p>
<p>this is typically Willet file what is</p>
<p>remaining useful life but you can bring</p>
<p>in things like jupiter notebooks if you</p>
<p>already have models in Watson or or</p>
<p>Azure or those you can you can actually</p>
<p>bring them in as well</p>
<p>functions these are things like fast</p>
<p>Fourier transformations or functions</p>
<p>that you want to perform when you</p>
<p>manipulate things like Python scripts or</p>
<p>R scripts or certain signal folders that</p>
<p>you that you want to do so these are</p>
<p>more function based not so much</p>
<p>transforming the data but just applying</p>
<p>the data and getting an answer and or</p>
<p>something and then lastly and almost</p>
<p>most importantly is what are the actions</p>
<p>that you want to do because we're not</p>
<p>trying to do this just so that we can</p>
<p>detect them we actually want to respond</p>
<p>to them so it's around event response</p>
<p>and then optimizing that response</p>
<p>so these are the different action agents</p>
<p>and again a subset so in MI for example</p>
<p>want to say another email as you can see</p>
<p>we've got a SMA severe I might want to</p>
<p>update a 3m smart contract I may want to</p>
<p>send it to a chat bot I may want to</p>
<p>broad range again and then the generic</p>
<p>interfaces like race type II eyes and</p>
<p>and other standard protocols and formats</p>
<p>that you can send things through so</p>
<p>again just a subset and you can also</p>
<p>send it into XM Pro into the app</p>
<p>designer into the into the application</p>
<p>itself where we run rules and</p>
<p>recommendations and have a user</p>
<p>interface for all of this data that</p>
<p>we've put together again a very simple</p>
<p>example if I double click on this what</p>
<p>it'll show you is just how I set up this</p>
<p>the configuration for this I'll show you</p>
<p>another example in a minute of a PI</p>
<p>server or OSI soft server where the</p>
<p>configuration very similar</p>
<p>it just has different fields and</p>
<p>information you can see this is what</p>
<p>it's bossing me in my OPC UI link that</p>
<p>it's sending so this is the topic that</p>
<p>it sends it to and I just subscribe to</p>
<p>this endpoint and I'm getting streaming</p>
<p>data into the application itself so if I</p>
<p>show a live view of that information I</p>
<p>can actually see some of the data coming</p>
<p>in and this is a unit that sits in our</p>
<p>Dallas office so I can get temperature</p>
<p>vibration readings and just to show you</p>
<p>that this is actually connecting from</p>
<p>live data and this instance this is just</p>
<p>one but it could be reading from from</p>
<p>multiple devices and for those I would</p>
<p>then get the individual ones so this is</p>
<p>just a live data view this is not a</p>
<p>dashboard that we show to the in</p>
<p>customer this is really just to see that</p>
<p>the data that comes out the the thing is</p>
<p>the data that we've all that we are</p>
<p>looking for so very briefly this is what</p>
<p>I this is how we connect up those 20</p>
<p>data sources if I go back</p>
<p>and if we look at and so you just got</p>
<p>back to the pumps and just to very</p>
<p>quickly show a more advanced or expanded</p>
<p>version it's still a predictive still a</p>
<p>centrifugal pump still getting</p>
<p>temperature vibration but now we're</p>
<p>getting pressure and flow from OSI soft</p>
<p>in this instance I still have access to</p>
<p>all the same connectors so I can drag</p>
<p>them on my can have multiple inputs and</p>
<p>again this is how you connect up the 20</p>
<p>different data sources in this instance</p>
<p>is reading from a set beam you can see</p>
<p>from a confer configuration point of</p>
<p>view this is slightly different to the</p>
<p>one that I showed before but I'm I can</p>
<p>and this is looking at the OSI soft</p>
<p>asset framework for example and brings</p>
<p>back the elements as well as the</p>
<p>components and I can choose some of the</p>
<p>others that I might want them I want the</p>
<p>Impella size or something like that so</p>
<p>this is how I set that up in this</p>
<p>instance it's the same we're still</p>
<p>checking for thresholds but I'm also</p>
<p>calling a predictive model in this</p>
<p>instance Azure based model to predict</p>
<p>the likelihood of failure is this thing</p>
<p>likely to fail yes or no if it is I want</p>
<p>to run a sec a second predictive model</p>
<p>so I can join models together and in</p>
<p>this instance what is remaining useful</p>
<p>life how much time do I have before this</p>
<p>pump fails and again I'm sending this</p>
<p>into my ex-emperor ab designer which</p>
<p>I'll show you in a minute how we now get</p>
<p>this data into a user interface but this</p>
<p>is a key aspect in a really important</p>
<p>aspect of being able to build real time</p>
<p>event response solutions is being able</p>
<p>to connect to multiple data sources get</p>
<p>a high volume of data flowing fast and</p>
<p>being able to find the exceptions and</p>
<p>find the key events that you are looking</p>
<p>for and bring the data from from big</p>
<p>data to small data to the action that</p>
<p>you actually want to do just to try and</p>
<p>build a dashboard that connects to all</p>
<p>of these sources it doesn't have the</p>
<p>capability to help you find the key</p>
<p>things it can show you the tank level it</p>
<p>doesn't tell you whether the tank level</p>
<p>is actually a problem and I'll get back</p>
<p>to the tank level</p>
<p>in a minute so this is the data designer</p>
<p>so if I go back to the so this is the</p>
<p>the data stream designer and this is</p>
<p>where we connect all of these data what</p>
<p>we now want to do is create them using</p>
<p>the fly so just show it to someone so</p>
<p>that they can see what's happening they</p>
<p>want to see certain of the areas and</p>
<p>then have some recommendations around</p>
<p>what to do now</p>
<p>we don't call these dashboards for us</p>
<p>they are event boards and the reason is</p>
<p>the purpose is slightly different so if</p>
<p>I quickly go in and show you an example</p>
<p>of such a event board this is connected</p>
<p>to some data flowing at the back and</p>
<p>here's the event board so what this</p>
<p>tells me is there are certain key events</p>
<p>starting to happen or both things are</p>
<p>already happening there's an event right</p>
<p>now or there's a likely event starting</p>
<p>to happen it doesn't show me the tank</p>
<p>level it this differs from an HMI view</p>
<p>or a control system view or something</p>
<p>like that where you can see the speeds</p>
<p>and feeds and the motor amps and all</p>
<p>those information which in actual fact</p>
<p>you don't really care too much about</p>
<p>until you know it's wrong so I need to</p>
<p>know whether a high tank level is a good</p>
<p>thing or a bad thing just having an</p>
<p>indicator telling me this is sitting at</p>
<p>the top doesn't really tell me if this</p>
<p>is a good event or a bad event or and is</p>
<p>it something I should be concerned about</p>
<p>or not and that's the whole purpose of</p>
<p>what we call event board so we put these</p>
<p>event boards together and there's</p>
<p>different ways of displaying the</p>
<p>information so this is one way so in</p>
<p>this instance you can see there's a</p>
<p>problem with this bump and we'll get</p>
<p>into the recommendation that was fired</p>
<p>for this in a minute but B I just want</p>
<p>to show you a slightly different example</p>
<p>of and if I go back to this if I look at</p>
<p>the conveyors on that on that plant</p>
<p>itself I can also have a different view</p>
<p>way for all the different two conveyors</p>
<p>I can see certain properties and I can</p>
<p>have a rule behind the property to say</p>
<p>well in terms of this instance the the</p>
<p>the amps on the motors for this conveyor</p>
<p>is this a challenge and they might be</p>
<p>because the this certain real-time</p>
<p>information and again I can show you</p>
<p>whether this is good or bad and what</p>
<p>does it mean which is more important</p>
<p>than just having a tonnage</p>
<p>it's decide is this tonnage good or is</p>
<p>it bad it's the multi amps good or is it</p>
<p>bad is something starting to happen and</p>
<p>do I need to respond to it</p>
<p>so again just going back to this plant</p>
<p>over here and I could actually have just</p>
<p>gone through into that but I will let's</p>
<p>look at the mod example so in this</p>
<p>instance I can see the discharge</p>
<p>pressures current fluorides I can see</p>
<p>and over a period of time so I can see</p>
<p>certain information around that now</p>
<p>you'll recall a whole bunch of dots Anya</p>
<p>and I told me this is a good event or a</p>
<p>bad event or the way that you decide in</p>
<p>terms of the colouring is at read events</p>
<p>or needs immediately action a yellow</p>
<p>events might be longer this is really</p>
<p>completely up to to you to configure</p>
<p>when you design these apps and I'll show</p>
<p>in a minute how we put these together</p>
<p>but before I do that I just want to show</p>
<p>you what a recommendation is so here's</p>
<p>an example of a pump that we drill down</p>
<p>to and I can either access it from here</p>
<p>or let me go into the pump itself I look</p>
<p>at some of the information I can see</p>
<p>what's happening and now I click into</p>
<p>the recommendation another</p>
<p>recommendation is how we act on the</p>
<p>event and what you'll see is this is the</p>
<p>data that fired that instance so you can</p>
<p>see in the past it's been resolved this</p>
<p>is the this is the real time data that</p>
<p>fired this is the I can put in a</p>
<p>recommendation recommendation here to</p>
<p>see to say or to say please check</p>
<p>something or do something or what or</p>
<p>make a suggestion to the maintenance</p>
<p>planner or in terms of what they should</p>
<p>put on the work order to say this is a</p>
<p>test impeller</p>
<p>and I'm not going to this is a tasting</p>
<p>Bella up can't spell please discuss with</p>
<p>manufacturers so I can now so the</p>
<p>reliability engineer or some subject</p>
<p>Mattox but can actually look at we're</p>
<p>going to type all of it out so you can</p>
<p>talk to the manufacturer I can either do</p>
<p>this automated or what we find a lot of</p>
<p>organizations want I want to create a</p>
<p>work request number so in the ASAP or</p>
<p>Oracle or Maximo system they were going</p>
<p>create a work request number and we</p>
<p>would then Paul that system to see when</p>
<p>a work order is created by the</p>
<p>maintenance planet this could be done</p>
<p>fully or automated as well so right at</p>
<p>the india you could actually just create</p>
<p>a work order inside sa p if you wanted</p>
<p>to but in this example we are doing that</p>
<p>you can also put together different</p>
<p>instructions and the way that you set</p>
<p>this up which is actually kind of more</p>
<p>important in a way is setting up these</p>
<p>rules for these recommendations is and</p>
<p>I'm just going to go into manage</p>
<p>recommendations this is the area where I</p>
<p>can manage a lot of all of these rules</p>
<p>that I set up around specific events</p>
<p>that I want to fire and these are the</p>
<p>ones that you saw the red dot and you</p>
<p>saw the yellow dot appears for that red</p>
<p>threshold this is the rule that and you</p>
<p>can see this is a very simple rule that</p>
<p>we've got with the data that that's</p>
<p>that's coming out of our taste system</p>
<p>but I can do I can just create that red</p>
<p>threshold what could be a low suction</p>
<p>pressure or in this instance distance</p>
<p>pressure high threshold or in this very</p>
<p>simply named red here and then the</p>
<p>information that flows in this data</p>
<p>stream that you see word game weight</p>
<p>it's this this is the data that actually</p>
<p>flows out here so I've got access to all</p>
<p>of these different fields that I can now</p>
<p>put a rule against then when this rule</p>
<p>is true it will put that dot on there</p>
<p>for me or whatever other indicate that</p>
<p>the dot is just one that we find is</p>
<p>pretty pretty Universal but you could</p>
<p>put any indicator or any notification</p>
<p>that goes with that I can either have a</p>
<p>value or it could be something another</p>
<p>variable that comes in that so if the</p>
<p>flow rate is less or equal to the power</p>
<p>this one doesn't make sense but it</p>
<p>illustrates the concept of what we are</p>
<p>doing here and I now have a rule and</p>
<p>when the con when the data flows through</p>
<p>this data flow it finds the true</p>
<p>condition it would then give me the</p>
<p>notification it would put the it would</p>
<p>put the dot on the on the equipment for</p>
<p>me and also give me this recommendation</p>
<p>which I saw earlier that I can now</p>
<p>either great work requests have stand</p>
<p>procedures around how to fix this and</p>
<p>use this as a recommended action now the</p>
<p>benefit of this is this can be done by</p>
<p>someone who's been there like 45 years</p>
<p>you captured it in their knowledge</p>
<p>around what would you do when these</p>
<p>conditions exist what would you</p>
<p>recommended actions be and through that</p>
<p>you also build up in your knowledge base</p>
<p>the best actions under certain certain</p>
<p>circumstances the other benefit is that</p>
<p>person who's who knows how to operate</p>
<p>and use this doesn't always have to sit</p>
<p>in the control room they can sit in the</p>
<p>in the office in the boardroom they</p>
<p>could even sit in the bedroom and be</p>
<p>able to monitor look at things and then</p>
<p>make decisions on what are the best next</p>
<p>actions that you could do now there's a</p>
<p>lot more to this but one last thing I</p>
<p>just want to show you is how do you set</p>
<p>up these now this is running on live</p>
<p>data so I'm just going to use this a</p>
<p>slightly different system but we'll</p>
<p>still have the same</p>
<p>view this is how I manage and set up</p>
<p>those applications so I'm just going to</p>
<p>use the landing page for now and this is</p>
<p>how you design those event boards it is</p>
<p>a user interface for that and we have</p>
<p>all the you build it up completely</p>
<p>through a drag-and-drop user interface</p>
<p>so different layout components so and</p>
<p>I'm not going to go through all of them</p>
<p>but you can see this charts these</p>
<p>checkboxes is data selectors is file</p>
<p>uploaders grids lists sliders sparklines</p>
<p>graphs different kinds of charts and</p>
<p>graphs the certain actions like</p>
<p>hyperlinks it'll take you around and</p>
<p>most importantly widgets so I can make</p>
<p>this so if I take the whole area that</p>
<p>you see here I can actually turn this</p>
<p>into a widget I just save it and now</p>
<p>next time I can reuse this sorry and</p>
<p>just go back to the blocks I can reuse</p>
<p>this as a widget now wiring this up to</p>
<p>the page data and the underlying data</p>
<p>this is all handled through through the</p>
<p>data stream and the data stream</p>
<p>connectors for the app so the app can</p>
<p>get its real-time information from that</p>
<p>data stream it can display it to you and</p>
<p>then you set up the logic or the way</p>
<p>that you want to display this</p>
<p>information with what you want where how</p>
<p>and again we've got templates for</p>
<p>different layouts but you can also take</p>
<p>components like this that you reuse a</p>
<p>lot and make them into widgets so that's</p>
<p>kind of the 50,000 foot view of what</p>
<p>ex-emperor is how we put this all</p>
<p>together and again just the reiterate it</p>
<p>consists of three different components I</p>
<p>can get my 20 different systems that I</p>
<p>look at combine the data get a logical</p>
<p>for flow of data going through it and so</p>
<p>I can go from Big Data all of these</p>
<p>different systems</p>
<p>into smarter data into the actions that</p>
<p>I want I can visualize it but also</p>
<p>behind this I can set up the rules to</p>
<p>send emails SMS notifications to systems</p>
<p>like themes slack or whatever it is</p>
<p>where you want these actions to be</p>
<p>notified</p>
<p>I can then drill down into a</p>
<p>recommendation and decide what action I</p>
<p>want this could automatically create an</p>
<p>action into a back-end work or the</p>
<p>system for you for example but this is</p>
<p>how we help you to detect and respond to</p>
<p>critical events in real time without</p>
<p>having to look at data or systems or 20</p>
<p>different things where the data could be</p>
<p>thank you for your time if you have any</p>
<p>additional questions or would like to</p>
<p>have more information please contact us</p>
<p>and we'd happy to give you a more</p>
<p>detailed presentation and demonstration</p>
