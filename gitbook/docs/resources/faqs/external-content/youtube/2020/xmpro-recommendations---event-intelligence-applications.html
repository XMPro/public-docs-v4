<p>XMPRO Recommendations are advanced event alerts that combine alerts, actions, and monitoring. You can create recommendations based on business rules and AI logic to recommend the best next actions to take when a certain event happens.</p>
<p>Go to <a href="https://xmpro.com">https://xmpro.com</a> if you want to learn more about how you can build real-time applications with our low-code Event Intelligence Platform.</p>

<summary>Transcript</summary>ex-emperor recommendations are advanced
<p>event alerts that combines alerts</p>
<p>actions and monitoring it creates new</p>
<p>event alerts based on business rules and</p>
<p>or AR logic and it recommends the best</p>
<p>next action based on expert suggestions</p>
<p>it also monitors the actions and the</p>
<p>outcomes to close the loop on event</p>
<p>response</p>
<p>this means that operations can respond</p>
<p>to critical events based on expert</p>
<p>knowledge in the organization before the</p>
<p>opportunity expires while managers can</p>
<p>close the loop by monitoring that it's</p>
<p>done in a timely and appropriate manner</p>
<p>let me run you through the exemplary</p>
<p>recommendations creating simple</p>
<p>applications thought by bringing in data</p>
<p>from multiple data sources and we create</p>
<p>some application or visualization around</p>
<p>it and then put that in front of users</p>
<p>to respond to key or critical business</p>
<p>events with recommended actions based on</p>
<p>the knowledge of those experts in the</p>
<p>organization and that is the role of</p>
<p>recommendations in there in the</p>
<p>excellent pro system so let me show you</p>
<p>how that works this is an example of an</p>
<p>XM pro event app it was configured with</p>
<p>our app designer and it features an</p>
<p>event board in this instance that</p>
<p>highlights key events that are starting</p>
<p>to happen across certain areas of my</p>
<p>plant and certain equipment and for each</p>
<p>of those they are recommendations which</p>
<p>were triggered based on conditions for</p>
<p>this as well as recommended actions on</p>
<p>what to take and again there's some</p>
<p>other additional information from a</p>
<p>application point of view that might be</p>
<p>interesting for us what I'm interested</p>
<p>in at this stage is the recommendation</p>
<p>around this bump now I could drill into</p>
<p>the actual bump and look at it but what</p>
<p>I'll do from here is just have a quick</p>
<p>look and see what this recommendation is</p>
<p>what the alert was that triggered it and</p>
<p>what the recommended action is around</p>
<p>resolving this let me draw into this</p>
<p>bump so this is the data that triggered</p>
<p>that recommendation for certain</p>
<p>conditions when</p>
<p>it and I'll demonstrate that in a minute</p>
<p>what those rules are behind this but</p>
<p>this was the die turn that they</p>
<p>triggered that these are some of the</p>
<p>instructions around how to potentially</p>
<p>do this but because I've been working on</p>
<p>this blonde for a long time and I also</p>
<p>know some of the other conditions and</p>
<p>other equipment I could provide a</p>
<p>comment and you from my expert point of</p>
<p>view and provide input to the person</p>
<p>that actually needs to go and do</p>
<p>something on this now in this example</p>
<p>there's potentially a problem with the</p>
<p>in-line fault on the cooling tower and</p>
<p>that's why we're eating something around</p>
<p>the block suction pipe and it's causing</p>
<p>a challenge with the discharge pressure</p>
<p>so this is one of the mechanisms of</p>
<p>capturing knowledge that's been there</p>
<p>for a long for a long time people who</p>
<p>have had experience on that plant or</p>
<p>that type of equipment you can very</p>
<p>quickly identify some of the key things</p>
<p>that we might need to do so now that</p>
<p>I've done that I can either</p>
<p>automatically create a work order or</p>
<p>work request into a back-end system but</p>
<p>in this instance I will just put in this</p>
<p>work request number that I've created in</p>
<p>my yeah M system or plant maintenance</p>
<p>system and it will then as soon as I</p>
<p>save this and it finds that a</p>
<p>maintenance plan or someone has created</p>
<p>a work order for that it would then</p>
<p>bring that work order information back</p>
<p>for me in real time so that I can see</p>
<p>this has been actioned that information</p>
<p>is then brought together in terms of</p>
<p>looking at how we follow this process so</p>
<p>I can now monitor and that there was an</p>
<p>alert that I put in a request and that</p>
<p>request at some stage is turned into a</p>
<p>work order and I can also monitor the</p>
<p>work order status to make sure that</p>
<p>these alerts are being addressed now</p>
<p>how we set these alerts up is under the</p>
<p>rules side of it so we manage the</p>
<p>recommendations and again this is a kind</p>
<p>of a global view of all the</p>
<p>recommendations and I can resolve them</p>
<p>are they individually or as a group but</p>
<p>what I'll do in this instance is</p>
<p>actually look at the rules behind them</p>
<p>how do we set up these recommendations</p>
<p>now that specific one for the pump on</p>
<p>the discharge brazier and I'm gonna this</p>
<p>is not a detailed explanation but just a</p>
<p>very high-level explanation of how you</p>
<p>would put that together we had that out</p>
<p>of efficiency range rule so that you can</p>
<p>have multiple rules that you set up and</p>
<p>in this instance this information for</p>
<p>this rule comes from the data stream</p>
<p>that sits behind it so we've got real</p>
<p>time flowing data and this then</p>
<p>interrogate that data based on the</p>
<p>frequency that you said it could be</p>
<p>every second every five minutes if</p>
<p>you're half an hour half a day or a day</p>
<p>or whatever works for this specific</p>
<p>business guys in terms of how frequently</p>
<p>we want to run and check that against</p>
<p>this rule we've said the the parameters</p>
<p>for that it doesn't have to be a numeric</p>
<p>number it could also bring back me if I</p>
<p>use for example feed right and versus</p>
<p>flour right so if the flour is really</p>
<p>less than the feed right then I might</p>
<p>want to trigger this so this is how you</p>
<p>set up recommendations and those</p>
<p>recommendations are the ones that you</p>
<p>saw at the front where it creates those</p>
<p>red bubbles or red dots to tell me that</p>
<p>there's something wrong and I can now</p>
<p>quickly see key events I can quickly see</p>
<p>what the recommendations are and then I</p>
<p>can start monitoring the process in</p>
<p>terms of how long did it take to</p>
<p>generate in terms of someone being</p>
<p>assigned assigned to resolve and on how</p>
<p>long does it take us to resolve these</p>
<p>and also how many of these</p>
<p>recommendations are being acted upon and</p>
<p>that provides the full feedback loop to</p>
<p>make sure that we don't only alert but</p>
<p>we also recommend what to do and then</p>
<p>check that that is being done in the</p>
<p>best and timely way</p>
