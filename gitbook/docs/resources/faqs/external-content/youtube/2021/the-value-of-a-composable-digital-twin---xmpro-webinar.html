<summary>Transcript</summary>good morning good afternoon or good
<p>evening</p>
<p>wherever you are joining us from and</p>
<p>welcome to this webinar on the value of</p>
<p>a composable digital twin</p>
<p>i'm peter von sculpek and i've been</p>
<p>around this space for a while</p>
<p>i am the ceo of xm pro and probably the</p>
<p>chief</p>
<p>technology enthusiast in the</p>
<p>organization</p>
<p>i'm also the chair for the natural</p>
<p>resources working group</p>
<p>in the digital twin consortium and prior</p>
<p>to that</p>
<p>i was the chair for the digital twin</p>
<p>interoperability task group in the</p>
<p>industrial internet consortium</p>
<p>now you'll probably agree with me that</p>
<p>2020</p>
<p>will certainly go down in history as one</p>
<p>of the most</p>
<p>disruptive uncertain and transformative</p>
<p>years for</p>
<p>both organizations and people in those</p>
<p>organizations worldwide</p>
<p>was one of my one of my learned friends</p>
<p>explained it to me said overnight it</p>
<p>exposed the systemic fragility in the</p>
<p>operating capabilities of enterprises</p>
<p>and organizations that's quite a</p>
<p>mouthful</p>
<p>but it really just means there were a</p>
<p>lot of challenges a lot of confusion</p>
<p>and many many organizations and people</p>
<p>struggle to deal with</p>
<p>the impact of what we saw in 2020</p>
<p>i think you'll also agree with me that</p>
<p>we've seen unprecedented acceleration of</p>
<p>digital</p>
<p>technology adoption and we've also seen</p>
<p>a lot of behavioural transformation</p>
<p>again within</p>
<p>organizations and businesses but also in</p>
<p>people</p>
<p>in those organizations and businesses</p>
<p>throughout this pandemic</p>
<p>we've seen five years of digital</p>
<p>transformation happen</p>
<p>in less than five months and that's</p>
<p>according to a number of industry</p>
<p>analysts</p>
<p>the future reality is that the rate of</p>
<p>change will probably only increase</p>
<p>professor peter frisk who consults to</p>
<p>large organizations as well as</p>
<p>governments and he specializes in what</p>
<p>is called innovative</p>
<p>business futures says that we will</p>
<p>probably see</p>
<p>more change the next 10 years than what</p>
<p>we've seen in the last 250.</p>
<p>now that is really exciting but it's</p>
<p>also really scary</p>
<p>what is even more sobering is the fact</p>
<p>that the future change</p>
<p>that peter frisk was talking about is</p>
<p>actually here right now</p>
<p>so right now we see long-term planning</p>
<p>visions from</p>
<p>organizations like gartner extend to six</p>
<p>to eight years which is really just</p>
<p>around the corner in business</p>
<p>and it should already be on your</p>
<p>strategic planning horizon</p>
<p>everything else is shorter term as you</p>
<p>can see here and these are</p>
<p>significant emerging technologies that</p>
<p>will that will change how we work</p>
<p>the impact of everything else that that</p>
<p>is on here is already here</p>
<p>and it should already be in your</p>
<p>short-term plans</p>
<p>the challenge that many organizations</p>
<p>face is that the traditional business</p>
<p>models were designed when computerized</p>
<p>business was still in its infancy it was</p>
<p>seen as a department that supplied the</p>
<p>computers the servers the</p>
<p>the the the it nerds that help you when</p>
<p>you got stuck on your</p>
<p>on your notebook or or um</p>
<p>on if the printer didn't work and</p>
<p>the the reality is that</p>
<p>even though it improved business</p>
<p>efficiency</p>
<p>it was never the platform for business</p>
<p>and business users uh were</p>
<p>were and are frustrated with digital</p>
<p>transformation plans</p>
<p>that are using that are more about</p>
<p>digitizing so getting things into</p>
<p>digital format and getting it onto ipads</p>
<p>and tablets and mobiles</p>
<p>so just digitizing rather than changing</p>
<p>business models</p>
<p>to be able to to and use it to drive and</p>
<p>be the platform</p>
<p>for this transformational change</p>
<p>what we also see is that um</p>
<p>the it's not just internal but</p>
<p>externally there's a lot of pressure on</p>
<p>on organizations</p>
<p>and uh we have less time to respond</p>
<p>companies don't last that long anymore</p>
<p>and the risk of a rigid</p>
<p>inflexible business is really that you</p>
<p>will be extinct lifespan have gone from</p>
<p>75 years in 1950</p>
<p>to just 15 years in 2020</p>
<p>and the other sobering statistic is that</p>
<p>52 percent</p>
<p>of um fortune 500 companies</p>
<p>um in that were in in the</p>
<p>in 2000 are not around in 2020</p>
<p>so if you think about how blockbuster</p>
<p>got</p>
<p>netflixed uh that is what happened to a</p>
<p>lot</p>
<p>what's happening to a lot of</p>
<p>organizations and uh</p>
<p>what i'm thinking um about quite often</p>
<p>is what will the average lifespan be</p>
<p>in 2040 now</p>
<p>we also come from a kind of past three</p>
<p>decades where everything was dominated</p>
<p>by large-scale monolithic</p>
<p>technology platforms such as erps</p>
<p>and crms and it was all about stability</p>
<p>efficiency</p>
<p>driving process efficiency optimization</p>
<p>and again it was mostly focused around</p>
<p>improving efficiencies</p>
<p>in processes the problem going forward</p>
<p>or the challenge going forward is that</p>
<p>these systems are typically very rigid</p>
<p>and don't support the pace of change</p>
<p>that we see</p>
<p>it may have worked for the change in the</p>
<p>last 250 years but it certainly</p>
<p>doesn't support the agility innovation</p>
<p>and experimentation that is needed</p>
<p>uh going into the future uh this is a</p>
<p>quote</p>
<p>from gartner on on on on</p>
<p>the the um enterprise architecture</p>
<p>models that are needed for the future</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>according to them developing a software</p>
<p>engineering strategy that is fit for</p>
<p>for the future is a huge struggle as</p>
<p>business landscapes are constantly</p>
<p>shifting and user demands</p>
<p>are increasing exponentially application</p>
<p>leaders</p>
<p>should demand adherence to composable</p>
<p>enterprise architecture</p>
<p>in their business applications now this</p>
<p>is just one quote</p>
<p>from from gartner organization we see</p>
<p>that in best of class businesses doing</p>
<p>this what you'll find</p>
<p>is or you may find yourself in knee-deep</p>
<p>in</p>
<p>in these challenges as i mentioned</p>
<p>before and typically we</p>
<p>we see two two approaches to to</p>
<p>to addressing this the one is how do we</p>
<p>fix the problem how how do i become the</p>
<p>the fixer and this is where uh</p>
<p>the digital transformation and digital</p>
<p>technologies</p>
<p>can support going through a approach</p>
<p>as was mentioned on the on the previous</p>
<p>slide of composable applications it</p>
<p>gives us the ability to</p>
<p>to fix and change as we go but we also</p>
<p>have the fissures so we have the fixers</p>
<p>and the fishes the fishes are</p>
<p>are really where business can exploit</p>
<p>these opportunities that are this how do</p>
<p>we fish while this is happening while</p>
<p>we're fixing on the</p>
<p>on the other end because this will be a</p>
<p>continuous way</p>
<p>of of of things happening going forward</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>in actual fact we've seen massive floods</p>
<p>in australia where i'm doing this from</p>
<p>um at the moment</p>
<p>uh over the last couple of weeks where</p>
<p>a year ago it was it was massive fires</p>
<p>we then had</p>
<p>all bushfires we then had um covered and</p>
<p>now we've got</p>
<p>flood so so um the environment is</p>
<p>definitely a lot more fluid things</p>
<p>happen quickly and how do we fish while</p>
<p>that has happened how do we make our</p>
<p>business agile</p>
<p>managing this or doing this actually</p>
<p>requires three key business changes and</p>
<p>the first one</p>
<p>is um that there's a certain</p>
<p>that that you need to be able to use a</p>
<p>modular approach for applications that</p>
<p>can be composed or recomposed on demand</p>
<p>so you need to have that ability to</p>
<p>respond quickly</p>
<p>the next part is that business and</p>
<p>technology</p>
<p>should be closer aligned and it should</p>
<p>be focused on how do we enable business</p>
<p>experts those that can fish</p>
<p>to support them to be able to do it</p>
<p>quicker and faster</p>
<p>and in the past the the systems that we</p>
<p>had</p>
<p>was not really designed for this it was</p>
<p>not</p>
<p>enabling business users uh from us</p>
<p>to to make themselves sufficient um it's</p>
<p>the the third part is around uh</p>
<p>traditional</p>
<p>solutions um reduce the capability for</p>
<p>fast</p>
<p>decision making to make the best</p>
<p>decisions quickly</p>
<p>and being contextualized and informed</p>
<p>and that's really what what the business</p>
<p>users need in order to drive um</p>
<p>or to be able to adapt at the pace that</p>
<p>we that we see</p>
<p>and for that the best way of approaching</p>
<p>this is to create a composable reusable</p>
<p>approach which gartner refers to as</p>
<p>intelligent composable business</p>
<p>applications different analysts call</p>
<p>them different names essentially the</p>
<p>same</p>
<p>the same background or the same thing so</p>
<p>before we look at composable digital</p>
<p>twins let's have a quick look at what a</p>
<p>composable business application is</p>
<p>i'm using the gartner example here but</p>
<p>they are</p>
<p>this is actually based on or it has its</p>
<p>roots in</p>
<p>in sower and microservices and it's it's</p>
<p>being adopted by best in class</p>
<p>organizations in different</p>
<p>ways it is also</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>it starts with using traditional legacy</p>
<p>and business applications as we know</p>
<p>creating a data fabric that sits at the</p>
<p>bottom to support this but then building</p>
<p>these</p>
<p>packaged business capabilities pbcs</p>
<p>package business capabilities around</p>
<p>certain areas how do we compose how do</p>
<p>we put some of these capabilities</p>
<p>together</p>
<p>at this level and then have a</p>
<p>composition platform where we can string</p>
<p>some of these together compose with them</p>
<p>and those platforms typically handle the</p>
<p>integration composition</p>
<p>orchestration development as well as the</p>
<p>front end for it</p>
<p>so that users can create these specific</p>
<p>composed applications you can think of</p>
<p>using a the capabilities that's within</p>
<p>the erp or crm for many organizations</p>
<p>they only used a good 20 another 30</p>
<p>percent might be</p>
<p>used a lot less frequently and</p>
<p>50 of the functionality actually never</p>
<p>gets used</p>
<p>the objective with package business</p>
<p>applications is to to or</p>
<p>business capabilities is to actually</p>
<p>take</p>
<p>the key capabilities that you need and</p>
<p>be able to compose</p>
<p>highly relevant and reusable</p>
<p>and agile applications very quickly</p>
<p>an example of this before we get into</p>
<p>twins i thought i'd just share an</p>
<p>example of</p>
<p>analytics package business</p>
<p>capability and in this instance you'll</p>
<p>see</p>
<p>we take um capabilities like reporting</p>
<p>and package that as well as</p>
<p>uh uh um self-service analytics</p>
<p>predictive modeling</p>
<p>and all of these are what is what</p>
<p>what are what is referred to as the</p>
<p>specific</p>
<p>capabilities that are then packaged</p>
<p>together and what makes a package</p>
<p>business capability</p>
<p>in terms of characteristic it and it's</p>
<p>it's not about the technology but it's</p>
<p>about the</p>
<p>the capability so it's not looking at</p>
<p>what is what is</p>
<p>the underlying technology behind this</p>
<p>but what is the business capability that</p>
<p>i need in order to address a specific</p>
<p>business challenge</p>
<p>so these package business applications</p>
<p>are almost encapsulated software</p>
<p>components that</p>
<p>that describe a well-defined business</p>
<p>capability and it can be recognized by a</p>
<p>business user so something like a</p>
<p>leak detection model from a prediction</p>
<p>point of view that is a classic</p>
<p>package business capability</p>
<p>well-designed</p>
<p>package business capability are</p>
<p>typically modular so</p>
<p>they consist in a modular fashion and</p>
<p>you can</p>
<p>they're also autonomous so typically</p>
<p>self-sufficient</p>
<p>and they would stand on their own and</p>
<p>i'll show you some examples</p>
<p>at the end of the presentation of how</p>
<p>or what some of these look like also</p>
<p>orchestrated</p>
<p>so you can compose them and put them in</p>
<p>different sequences to address a</p>
<p>specific so you can assemble the process</p>
<p>flows or the or the</p>
<p>or the transactions through these apis</p>
<p>so that they are they are basically</p>
<p>packaged for composition</p>
<p>and then they are easily discoverable so</p>
<p>someone who's a business user again</p>
<p>would</p>
<p>very easily recognize that capability</p>
<p>without necessarily understanding all</p>
<p>the underlying technology that sits with</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>now this doesn't only apply to analytics</p>
<p>it also</p>
<p>applies to other areas in the business</p>
<p>and kind of this example</p>
<p>just shows where we can start with an</p>
<p>application like a patient</p>
<p>oh sorry application public package</p>
<p>business capability where we have</p>
<p>patient patient records and everything</p>
<p>that's said around that we may then have</p>
<p>a digital twin component which might be</p>
<p>an infection detector</p>
<p>the analytics component would handle</p>
<p>infection rate</p>
<p>predictions and then also on the data</p>
<p>side we might be building a data</p>
<p>repository of</p>
<p>some information that we want to do in</p>
<p>terms of infection</p>
<p>incidents or whatever the case might be</p>
<p>so this just shows you</p>
<p>how these work together it's not a</p>
<p>single type we actually compose an</p>
<p>application by using some application</p>
<p>digital twin</p>
<p>analytics and um other data</p>
<p>or or other package business</p>
<p>applications together</p>
<p>it's a it's kind of like</p>
<p>the lego bricks that kids use to build</p>
<p>or create</p>
<p>their own compositions which is only</p>
<p>limited by the imagination</p>
<p>the range of modular bricks enable the</p>
<p>kids to</p>
<p>for example create motion experience by</p>
<p>just packaging the wheels and it's</p>
<p>probably already got the battery and the</p>
<p>motor and everything packaged in this i</p>
<p>can clip this in</p>
<p>within a matter of seconds to create</p>
<p>that capability of</p>
<p>motion in this application that i have</p>
<p>here</p>
<p>um the other benefit is i can i can now</p>
<p>build it</p>
<p>the way that the manufacturer describes</p>
<p>it on the box or i can</p>
<p>adapt it and change the sequence of</p>
<p>things so that i have my own creation in</p>
<p>actual fact</p>
<p>um they can create their own</p>
<p>or i can use the same box of</p>
<p>capabilities and build a four by four</p>
<p>vehicle um</p>
<p>in in this example instead of having the</p>
<p>formula one racing car</p>
<p>reuse many of these components and build</p>
<p>a completely different</p>
<p>use case or application using many of</p>
<p>the same composable i may need a few</p>
<p>extra blocks that are not around here</p>
<p>like the bull bar or some</p>
<p>or one of the others and i may leave out</p>
<p>one or two</p>
<p>of these but in essence i can reuse or</p>
<p>recompose</p>
<p>very quickly based on the changing</p>
<p>environment</p>
<p>that i have when we now</p>
<p>and understanding what what composable</p>
<p>business</p>
<p>applications um uh give us</p>
<p>or uh and the package business</p>
<p>capabilities</p>
<p>that that exist within them we can also</p>
<p>look at</p>
<p>how this now starts applying to digital</p>
<p>twins so</p>
<p>as you can see on the digital twin we</p>
<p>have the physical side of things as well</p>
<p>as the digital and as we start packaging</p>
<p>these capabilities like</p>
<p>location scheduling leak detection these</p>
<p>are all package business capabilities</p>
<p>that make it really</p>
<p>easy to to create</p>
<p>new or to make our digital twin</p>
<p>applications address</p>
<p>very specific business cases now one of</p>
<p>the challenges that we sit with</p>
<p>um when we look at digital twins is</p>
<p>is that there's even more complexity</p>
<p>than what we see with</p>
<p>traditional erp or crm uh challenges the</p>
<p>other the good news though is that it</p>
<p>also naturally lends itself to</p>
<p>composability</p>
<p>and i i honestly believe that it's the</p>
<p>only way to build scalable digital twins</p>
<p>is to make them composable</p>
<p>otherwise you will remain stuck with a</p>
<p>few discrete</p>
<p>twins in pilot projects so you may end</p>
<p>up with a few</p>
<p>um sample ones in pilot projects or the</p>
<p>the dreaded pilot purgatory where um</p>
<p>this actually never move beyond that</p>
<p>stage because it's not composable i</p>
<p>can't take the spot plug it into</p>
<p>a assembly so going from a gearbox into</p>
<p>a ball mill on a mining plant</p>
<p>and then taking that mining plant</p>
<p>actually making part of the</p>
<p>the overall</p>
<p>processing plant for the for for the</p>
<p>mine or a factory or</p>
<p>or a a a power plant or whatever the</p>
<p>application</p>
<p>for this so the challenge with digital</p>
<p>twins is it is</p>
<p>it it requires this a capability of</p>
<p>compa</p>
<p>of being able to be composed so going</p>
<p>from a single node</p>
<p>a single entity into a assembly and that</p>
<p>assembly actually then getting into a</p>
<p>system</p>
<p>of of uh assembled components again</p>
<p>it lends itself naturally but also if</p>
<p>you don't have the if you don't keep</p>
<p>this composable approach in mind</p>
<p>you will probably get stuck by not</p>
<p>moving beyond this capability</p>
<p>over here and the reality that we also</p>
<p>see</p>
<p>is that um and again looking at</p>
<p>some of the stats coming out of analysts</p>
<p>is that</p>
<p>for larger organizations we'll probably</p>
<p>see them managing a thousand digital</p>
<p>twin templates</p>
<p>and a million digital twin instances by</p>
<p>2025 and this is pretty recent research</p>
<p>as well so</p>
<p>again the scale at which this needs to</p>
<p>be done the only way that you</p>
<p>couldn't do this there's no other way to</p>
<p>manage scalability</p>
<p>and quick time to value if you don't</p>
<p>have a composable</p>
<p>architecture so it is not just about the</p>
<p>single entity but it's about the whole</p>
<p>ecosystem the whole environment and how</p>
<p>it all fits together and this all needs</p>
<p>to be composable as this</p>
<p>use case may change this environment</p>
<p>around it will need that same</p>
<p>flexibility and ability</p>
<p>to change now</p>
<p>this is all well and great but we need</p>
<p>to be able to explain what the value of</p>
<p>all of this is</p>
<p>in monetary terms so when we go to</p>
<p>stakeholders and budget holders and get</p>
<p>money for these projects</p>
<p>we need to be able to explain the value</p>
<p>of these and the simplest way that i</p>
<p>found is using the world economic</p>
<p>forum's</p>
<p>total value at stake model and in that</p>
<p>model</p>
<p>kind of two dimensions which is what is</p>
<p>um for the industry or the your specific</p>
<p>business</p>
<p>and what is the other one what is the</p>
<p>value for the largest society</p>
<p>or society at large and the first one</p>
<p>is really around value migration so</p>
<p>being able to</p>
<p>create new business models do that</p>
<p>digital transformation and get new</p>
<p>revenue from new digital services that</p>
<p>we didn't have in the past</p>
<p>and also creating marketplaces for these</p>
<p>composed capabilities and how do we</p>
<p>market and sell those</p>
<p>to be able to make it easier for others</p>
<p>then there's the traditional approach</p>
<p>from a</p>
<p>what value do we add by just increasing</p>
<p>what we're already doing so how do we</p>
<p>how do we</p>
<p>exploit and move faster around current</p>
<p>short-term opportunities</p>
<p>but also how do we eliminate costs so</p>
<p>how do we make our plans</p>
<p>how do we improve the reliability</p>
<p>reliability</p>
<p>availability and all of those metrics</p>
<p>that we do right now but how can we do</p>
<p>it quicker</p>
<p>faster and and respond to the changes</p>
<p>uh much quicker then from a</p>
<p>valued stake for society point of view</p>
<p>the impact of this</p>
<p>the the savings that come with it but</p>
<p>also you know what is the impact of</p>
<p>being able to make better decisions</p>
<p>faster and that whole agility around</p>
<p>decision support with</p>
<p>com with a composable digital to an</p>
<p>approach</p>
<p>now as i mentioned at the start the</p>
<p>focus is really how can we get business</p>
<p>experts to be able to fish how do we get</p>
<p>how do we train or bring new skills to</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>subject matter eggs to experts to be</p>
<p>able to compose these digital twins</p>
<p>themselves what is the value in</p>
<p>being able to do that and then obviously</p>
<p>the the broader impact is making sure</p>
<p>that we have safer work environments</p>
<p>especially in the asset intensive</p>
<p>industries where we operate</p>
<p>and then lastly in terms of the impact</p>
<p>on the environment reducing emissions</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>all the sustainability metrics that we</p>
<p>can do and respond again</p>
<p>pretty quick on that a lot of</p>
<p>organizations are putting out</p>
<p>20 30 goals in terms of their</p>
<p>sustainability goals</p>
<p>it's not that far away so you really</p>
<p>need to make sure</p>
<p>that you have that you have that ability</p>
<p>to compose</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>green elements into the current digital</p>
<p>twins</p>
<p>and and package that capability and and</p>
<p>make it scalable</p>
<p>the the other benefit of a um composable</p>
<p>digital twin approach is that you can</p>
<p>basically build</p>
<p>the twins from the bottom up and you can</p>
<p>see immediate returns we often see that</p>
<p>companies start with these large-scale</p>
<p>projects that want to</p>
<p>address these really big large complex</p>
<p>problems now quite often</p>
<p>the result of that is that the project</p>
<p>team has moved on three years later</p>
<p>there's been no returns a composable</p>
<p>approach</p>
<p>actually help you to start it's a fast</p>
<p>affordable and easy to wait</p>
<p>easy to use way to start building up</p>
<p>from the bottom up</p>
<p>and actually get quick returns which</p>
<p>fund the larger projects so for example</p>
<p>in a</p>
<p>mid-sized organization if you've got 25</p>
<p>engineers and each of them</p>
<p>build 20 composed digital twins or</p>
<p>applications and each of those have an</p>
<p>impact</p>
<p>of of two million dollars you very</p>
<p>quickly get to an</p>
<p>overall impact of one billion dollars</p>
<p>which is</p>
<p>very possible and we've seen that with</p>
<p>our customers in terms of being able to</p>
<p>deliver that</p>
<p>then once you've got that better done</p>
<p>you've got the skills and you've</p>
<p>you've built enough packaged business</p>
<p>capabilities</p>
<p>in all these individual ones and reuse</p>
<p>them to start expanding</p>
<p>to more complex and advanced ones</p>
<p>um where we can now address some of</p>
<p>these bigger challenges in the</p>
<p>organization so first do the easy ones</p>
<p>before we get to some of the big bets</p>
<p>it's one of the really big benefits of</p>
<p>using a composable</p>
<p>architecture so how does this all apply</p>
<p>to digital twins</p>
<p>now from a</p>
<p>a model approach it's nothing other than</p>
<p>apis and integration as we know it but</p>
<p>what's fundamentally different is how</p>
<p>this is packaged together in terms of</p>
<p>of of standalone units that can then be</p>
<p>composed and the key aspect here is that</p>
<p>there's a composition environment that</p>
<p>allows me to to be able to put all of</p>
<p>this together so i can</p>
<p>compose my twins in an environment and</p>
<p>they are done in such a way the wrappers</p>
<p>around the apis are done in such a way</p>
<p>that it makes it a lot easier</p>
<p>to compose and almost visually program</p>
<p>this</p>
<p>one of the the the</p>
<p>things that we see with digital twins</p>
<p>and it's also covered in the ultimate</p>
<p>guide to digital twins um that's on our</p>
<p>website</p>
<p>um is kind of the data models and the</p>
<p>data sources that we see</p>
<p>in digital twins are pretty well</p>
<p>understood and defined so</p>
<p>um and these are the six characteristics</p>
<p>i'm not going to go through all of them</p>
<p>right now you can you can have a look</p>
<p>um on our website um and get access to</p>
<p>the ultimate guide to digital twins</p>
<p>where we go into</p>
<p>more detail on this but from a digital</p>
<p>twin perspective these are the key data</p>
<p>areas or data sources now what we want</p>
<p>to do with that is actually put it</p>
<p>into a framework similar to what</p>
<p>what we saw earlier around the</p>
<p>composable business applications but</p>
<p>make it very specific to composable</p>
<p>digital twins</p>
<p>and then use this the data fabric that</p>
<p>sits at the bottom</p>
<p>use this as a key element of that</p>
<p>and provide these services so we can</p>
<p>compose and package some of these things</p>
<p>together</p>
<p>still using our legacy ot and</p>
<p>engineering applications</p>
<p>and also the business and it</p>
<p>applications plug into them</p>
<p>bring it in either at the platform level</p>
<p>or at the data fabric level</p>
<p>but really creating these these</p>
<p>um packaged business capabilities that</p>
<p>address very specific elements</p>
<p>in it and through that we can compose</p>
<p>applications like</p>
<p>for example intelligent building energy</p>
<p>optimization or</p>
<p>blast furnace casting guidance or first</p>
<p>pass</p>
<p>yield in a in a production manufacturing</p>
<p>environment or</p>
<p>tailings and environmental monitoring in</p>
<p>mining and some of the other extractive</p>
<p>industries so these were the these are</p>
<p>the composed</p>
<p>applications they're kind of micro apps</p>
<p>in the business it</p>
<p>addresses a very specific business</p>
<p>challenge and i can very quickly change</p>
<p>these and make them adaptable</p>
<p>to changing environments</p>
<p>to by by just reusing the capabilities</p>
<p>that are packaged</p>
<p>in here and the way that we do that in</p>
<p>example is</p>
<p>on the one hand with our data stream so</p>
<p>at the integration level</p>
<p>and being able to bring in to integrate</p>
<p>compose and orchestrate is a key element</p>
<p>of of this</p>
<p>and having package business capabilities</p>
<p>here and and and being able to drag it</p>
<p>on</p>
<p>and on the other hand being able to</p>
<p>create the ux and</p>
<p>an environment in a similar way where</p>
<p>we've packaged capabilities that sit</p>
<p>around this</p>
<p>to be able to do just that again taking</p>
<p>these package business capabilities</p>
<p>um and and integrated there now some of</p>
<p>the examples and we'll run you through</p>
<p>this in a practical example um</p>
<p>on us on our software just to</p>
<p>demonstrate that but</p>
<p>some of our package business</p>
<p>capabilities as you can see here</p>
<p>there's quite a range of them where i</p>
<p>don't have to understand how to</p>
<p>i don't have to rewrite the code to</p>
<p>to be able to connect or for example an</p>
<p>azure smart contract i don't know i can</p>
<p>just</p>
<p>literally drag that capability onto the</p>
<p>canvas</p>
<p>and put it and wire it up with the rest</p>
<p>of my</p>
<p>and compose and integrate and</p>
<p>orchestrate rather than write all the</p>
<p>code that sits behind that so</p>
<p>being able to compose and reuse</p>
<p>capabilities like that</p>
<p>makes it very powerful and very quick to</p>
<p>adapt</p>
<p>when we need to make changes to our</p>
<p>system</p>
<p>then on the ux side very similar so if i</p>
<p>want something in unity i can just drag</p>
<p>the unity component on and just wire it</p>
<p>to the data</p>
<p>and the model so that i can reuse this</p>
<p>capability</p>
<p>or being able to compose very quickly</p>
<p>using this package business capability</p>
<p>before we go into the software and i</p>
<p>show you some examples</p>
<p>i just also like to put out a word of</p>
<p>caution in terms of</p>
<p>package business capabilities</p>
<p>be careful that it's not like the</p>
<p>the wall socket and plug situation that</p>
<p>we see</p>
<p>across the world where it may work in</p>
<p>your own environment but doesn't work</p>
<p>anywhere else you need to be able to</p>
<p>make sure that these things can also</p>
<p>connect</p>
<p>across different systems so</p>
<p>it doesn't help that it only works in</p>
<p>one area so when you look at a package</p>
<p>business capability it needs to be</p>
<p>extensible across</p>
<p>in different applications the way that</p>
<p>we do that</p>
<p>um and again i honestly believe this is</p>
<p>the only way to respond</p>
<p>um and scale to the</p>
<p>to the more complex challenges um</p>
<p>is with a composable digital to an</p>
<p>approach and</p>
<p>the first step is to do the inter is at</p>
<p>the integration</p>
<p>uh layer where we have package</p>
<p>capabilities so be able to compose data</p>
<p>streams using these package capabilities</p>
<p>and then integrate</p>
<p>data sources to that the second step is</p>
<p>to be able to compose the overall</p>
<p>applications from these</p>
<p>to provide a real-time view and then</p>
<p>lastly how to</p>
<p>also compose and reuse recommendations</p>
<p>that trigger when certain critical</p>
<p>things</p>
<p>happen you don't want to recreate all</p>
<p>the prescriptive</p>
<p>support in the business you actually</p>
<p>want to be able to compose certain</p>
<p>certain capabilities around that or</p>
<p>package some capabilities around that</p>
<p>and then compose it when you</p>
<p>need it so with that let me show you an</p>
<p>example of how this works</p>
<p>so i will move on to</p>
<p>and i'll just maximize this so i'll</p>
<p>start with</p>
<p>the data stream area as we mentioned</p>
<p>this is</p>
<p>the first part of the</p>
<p>of the process in step one it's where we</p>
<p>integrate</p>
<p>data into the system and i will just use</p>
<p>a</p>
<p>very quick simple example this is not a</p>
<p>full demonstration of our solution or</p>
<p>software if you do want there is a link</p>
<p>on our website you can see a full</p>
<p>demonstration of all the capabilities of</p>
<p>the software i'm just going to touch on</p>
<p>some of the key elements and show you</p>
<p>how some of those capabilities are</p>
<p>packaged i'm just going to use an</p>
<p>example</p>
<p>of a pump condition monitoring solution</p>
<p>that runs on something like azure</p>
<p>digital twin</p>
<p>and we have these different capabilities</p>
<p>that we've packaged so we call them</p>
<p>agents but they are they have different</p>
<p>functions that they</p>
<p>that they that they perform or so they</p>
<p>have certain capabilities they could</p>
<p>either be listeners so they listen for</p>
<p>real-time data</p>
<p>which is something like the telemetry</p>
<p>they could provide context so a</p>
<p>different</p>
<p>capability they could transform data</p>
<p>it could provide a machine learning</p>
<p>capability</p>
<p>and i'll drill down into into this a</p>
<p>little bit more</p>
<p>it could be things like functions like</p>
<p>fast fouriers or or things like that</p>
<p>which again is a package capability</p>
<p>and then run recommendations and</p>
<p>different actions so these are all</p>
<p>package capabilities and we'll drill</p>
<p>down on them a little bit more but</p>
<p>just to quickly explain the process that</p>
<p>we have here we're taking pump telemetry</p>
<p>data do some calculations for that push</p>
<p>it into</p>
<p>azure digital twin and also getting make</p>
<p>and model in context</p>
<p>combining that with the telemetry data</p>
<p>and running some engineering</p>
<p>recommendation rules that sit behind it</p>
<p>very simple example</p>
<p>but there are a number of package</p>
<p>capabilities in here that i can reuse so</p>
<p>one of them</p>
<p>for example is the pump telemetry so</p>
<p>this brings in real-time data from a</p>
<p>data source now i don't have to</p>
<p>understand how to code</p>
<p>mqtt or anything like that i can just</p>
<p>literally hook it up</p>
<p>to what the endpoint is where it sends</p>
<p>the data and it will then expose</p>
<p>the fields that it's got and i can reuse</p>
<p>or i can use these two so and again in</p>
<p>this one</p>
<p>this is the data that comes from</p>
<p>the pump telemetry i can either use all</p>
<p>of them or i can remove</p>
<p>just the ones that i that i want or need</p>
<p>now the way that i get that on</p>
<p>is i can literally drag the mqtt</p>
<p>package business capability onto the</p>
<p>canvas again i don't have to know how to</p>
<p>code this</p>
<p>i can just drag it on and use it</p>
<p>likewise with the um</p>
<p>and i'll just go to this one azure</p>
<p>digital twin</p>
<p>the capability here is around</p>
<p>um being able to interrogate</p>
<p>the the the or automatically publish to</p>
<p>azure digital twin but as you'll see we</p>
<p>don't only do azure digital twin here</p>
<p>we also push the real-time telemetry</p>
<p>into</p>
<p>time series insight so i can get some</p>
<p>time series</p>
<p>data if i want to again i don't have to</p>
<p>be able to code any of this i don't have</p>
<p>to understand how to do this in actual</p>
<p>fact being able to create new resources</p>
<p>on azure if you're not a</p>
<p>qualified azure engineer cloud engineer</p>
<p>this is not a</p>
<p>easy task we've made it much simpler by</p>
<p>being able to</p>
<p>create new resource instances for anyone</p>
<p>that's tried this you'll understand</p>
<p>exactly the value of having this package</p>
<p>business capability where i don't</p>
<p>i don't have to be a subject matter</p>
<p>expert also</p>
<p>a cloud deployment engineer i could be a</p>
<p>subject matter expert like a reliability</p>
<p>engineer process engineer a</p>
<p>geologist or someone like that who just</p>
<p>wants to set up a twin</p>
<p>in this service again this is a package</p>
<p>business capability i can drag it on i</p>
<p>can build</p>
<p>digital twins for for different</p>
<p>solutions it could be a pump assembly it</p>
<p>could be turbines it could be</p>
<p>buildings it could be anything so i</p>
<p>could upload new models here i don't</p>
<p>have to understand how to create</p>
<p>or um or write code for azure digital</p>
<p>twin i can</p>
<p>literally just reuse this</p>
<p>package business capability in order to</p>
<p>do that</p>
<p>and then things like azure digital too</p>
<p>sorry</p>
<p>time series insights if i want to push</p>
<p>the data into that</p>
<p>i can i can do that as well and one of</p>
<p>the benefits of</p>
<p>doing this approach is we can discover</p>
<p>for example the data that comes from</p>
<p>this package business capability</p>
<p>remember that</p>
<p>challenge with the different wall</p>
<p>sockets where i have different systems</p>
<p>that speak different</p>
<p>inputs and outputs what i can do with</p>
<p>this is</p>
<p>you know on this yellow arrow that i've</p>
<p>map that i've that i have here</p>
<p>it actually shows me the payload that</p>
<p>comes in the arrow so these are the</p>
<p>options that i have that comes in via</p>
<p>the arrow</p>
<p>and this is the service that i</p>
<p>interrogated on the other side so i</p>
<p>looked at what the wall plug needs</p>
<p>and this is that multi-plug capability</p>
<p>that now</p>
<p>make it easy to take this format into</p>
<p>this format</p>
<p>and the two can talk to each other very</p>
<p>powerful capability especially when it</p>
<p>comes to package business capability so</p>
<p>each of these can stand on its own</p>
<p>and again it might be something like i</p>
<p>want to bring in a</p>
<p>python environment so i can drag on a</p>
<p>python</p>
<p>script and wire it into the process and</p>
<p>i'm not going to do that right now</p>
<p>but i can wire this in and</p>
<p>and do something now this means i'm</p>
<p>handling a specific</p>
<p>error capability that comes out of</p>
<p>this and i can reuse this capability</p>
<p>very</p>
<p>easily so this is on the on the data</p>
<p>stream and integration side again this</p>
<p>is not a full presentation</p>
<p>but it gives you an overview what i</p>
<p>briefly want to touch on</p>
<p>and i'm just mindful of time is our</p>
<p>capabilities around</p>
<p>the composition environment so for that</p>
<p>digital twin that we just saw so if i</p>
<p>for example go to uh</p>
<p>this view over here so this is a front</p>
<p>end</p>
<p>i can compose and set up</p>
<p>my my environment here and i'll show you</p>
<p>all this this application again in a</p>
<p>very similar way</p>
<p>in this instance i'm bringing in data</p>
<p>from unity</p>
<p>i've got this unity view of a pump the</p>
<p>real-time data coming out of azure</p>
<p>digital twin</p>
<p>i've got some information coming out of</p>
<p>my erp now all of these are drag and</p>
<p>drop components</p>
<p>um from a composability point of view so</p>
<p>in this instance i might be doing</p>
<p>predictive maintenance on</p>
<p>or it might be way or it might be it</p>
<p>doesn't really matter what the use case</p>
<p>is i can very quickly adapt and change</p>
<p>based on a business problem that i may</p>
<p>have</p>
<p>and reconfigure this in order to be able</p>
<p>to do that now the way that i do that</p>
<p>again this is this capability around</p>
<p>packaging</p>
<p>and what you'll see so as the</p>
<p>subject matter expert i can't change</p>
<p>this one</p>
<p>because it's running and i'll get in</p>
<p>trouble if i screw it up but</p>
<p>i can drag on certain capabilities you</p>
<p>know it might be something</p>
<p>like um power bi</p>
<p>i think there's a there's a power bi or</p>
<p>it might be</p>
<p>esri maps or anything like that so again</p>
<p>package capabilities</p>
<p>that i that i just drag on and there's a</p>
<p>whole</p>
<p>it could be bentley autodesk um a broad</p>
<p>range of these</p>
<p>of these package capability in addition</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>simpler ones like what might be unity or</p>
<p>unreal engine</p>
<p>or it might just be a grid or a circular</p>
<p>gauge or something like that</p>
<p>it could be widgets so you can compose</p>
<p>and put together so i could take this</p>
<p>whole</p>
<p>section over here so this section or let</p>
<p>me just</p>
<p>let's say i like this whole section and</p>
<p>i want to save that i won't be able to</p>
<p>do it yet because</p>
<p>this is a live running one but i could</p>
<p>typically</p>
<p>save this share it with myself or others</p>
<p>and now i've published this capability</p>
<p>of package this</p>
<p>look and feel and i can share it with</p>
<p>myself i can use it for myself or</p>
<p>share it with others again very powerful</p>
<p>capability from a</p>
<p>from a composable digital twin</p>
<p>aspect in order to create these</p>
<p>composable uxes</p>
<p>that are that are that are built and</p>
<p>with the data integration and everything</p>
<p>that's it's</p>
<p>behind it likewise with um</p>
<p>and i'll just use this example again uh</p>
<p>i'll go back to that pump</p>
<p>and likewise with something like the</p>
<p>recommendations i may have a form</p>
<p>with certain information that i fill in</p>
<p>work order numbers create</p>
<p>instructions or i could reuse this for</p>
<p>everything that is similar</p>
<p>but this is the real-time data that</p>
<p>triggered and put the</p>
<p>red dot onto that screen how i resolve</p>
<p>it</p>
<p>i could have trios instructions i could</p>
<p>have discussions around this</p>
<p>i could have a timeline view on who did</p>
<p>what when</p>
<p>and as well as some analytics on this</p>
<p>and i'm not sure what we have for this</p>
<p>as you can see we had a whole bunch of</p>
<p>different</p>
<p>recommendation rules that triggered and</p>
<p>fired</p>
<p>for all of this there's a whole section</p>
<p>in the presentation</p>
<p>or the demonstration video on</p>
<p>recommendations a really powerful</p>
<p>capability inside xm pro it is a</p>
<p>package business capability which is</p>
<p>generically used as</p>
<p>recommendations but it's really really</p>
<p>powerful in terms of closing the loop</p>
<p>digital twins are there to address a</p>
<p>certain</p>
<p>challenge you're hiring a twin to do a</p>
<p>certain job</p>
<p>and you want to make sure that you're</p>
<p>able to close the loop</p>
<p>provide tell someone when something's</p>
<p>happened</p>
<p>and do the notification and everything</p>
<p>that sits behind that but also then</p>
<p>provide recommended actions instructions</p>
<p>forms that needs to be filled in and</p>
<p>all of this needs to be is is built in</p>
<p>such a way that it's easily</p>
<p>composable as well as reusable</p>
<p>so with that um hopefully that gives you</p>
<p>an overview of</p>
<p>what a a a composable digital twin is</p>
<p>and i will go to some questions</p>
<p>and see if there are any questions</p>
<p>around this</p>
<p>so let me just have a quick look here</p>
<p>so how granular should the capability be</p>
<p>in order to be effectively</p>
<p>packaged into a business capability</p>
<p>i think that's a great question so it</p>
<p>needs to be</p>
<p>according to that definition that i gave</p>
<p>uh i gave earlier it needs to be</p>
<p>um it needs to be able to stand on its</p>
<p>own so i need to be able to package and</p>
<p>if i just use an example here i need to</p>
<p>be able to</p>
<p>package a capability where for example a</p>
<p>fast fourier</p>
<p>i want to have that whole capability so</p>
<p>in terms of granularity</p>
<p>um it needs to be able to stand on its</p>
<p>own and it might also be something like</p>
<p>this azure digital twin where it can do</p>
<p>two things for me so it really depends</p>
<p>on on the on the use case that you</p>
<p>that you have what i wouldn't do is make</p>
<p>it so granular that it needs two or</p>
<p>three</p>
<p>together to actually make it work so</p>
<p>what is the</p>
<p>what is the lowest level or the</p>
<p>the smallest module that i can get to</p>
<p>that would still be self-sustainable so</p>
<p>when i drag a fast fourier on</p>
<p>that i just need to pass it the</p>
<p>parameters and it will give me an answer</p>
<p>and the rest of the flow can continue so</p>
<p>that's typically how we would</p>
<p>look at um composable uh or the</p>
<p>the pbc the package business capability</p>
<p>something like leak detection</p>
<p>or um remaining useful life</p>
<p>or something like that it needs to have</p>
<p>the net the smallest number of</p>
<p>components that will actually address</p>
<p>the capability and provide the full</p>
<p>capability</p>
<p>um for that for that for that specific</p>
<p>function that we are looking at it</p>
<p>doesn't have to address so pump con mon</p>
<p>this whole condition monitoring</p>
<p>that is kind of i wouldn't package this</p>
<p>as a as a or i have a whole package</p>
<p>business capability or</p>
<p>might be that in your use case that</p>
<p>would work that you have</p>
<p>this as the package business capability</p>
<p>but quite often we</p>
<p>we see that there are some nuances some</p>
<p>changes</p>
<p>and if you make it too big it needs a</p>
<p>lot of customization</p>
<p>where with something where where um it</p>
<p>is</p>
<p>contained like this it just makes it</p>
<p>really easy</p>
<p>to be able to drag it on and address my</p>
<p>specific challenge</p>
<p>uh there's one more question</p>
<p>i appreciate the application of</p>
<p>gartner's high level thinking into the</p>
<p>real world</p>
<p>um that being said much of the</p>
<p>presentation seems to reflect</p>
<p>um sort of the more forms based approach</p>
<p>asset intensive industries will also</p>
<p>require that digital twin support field</p>
<p>user experiences</p>
<p>what i forgot to mention is all of this</p>
<p>what you see on the front end</p>
<p>if i just go back</p>
<p>to what you see over here all of this is</p>
<p>available</p>
<p>on mobile devices so it is it is there</p>
<p>so you can take it into the field</p>
<p>um and it automatically so as you can</p>
<p>see when we design this you actually</p>
<p>design</p>
<p>and again from a pack from a business</p>
<p>capability we need to make sure that</p>
<p>these things run in different</p>
<p>environments so it is designed so that</p>
<p>the field service organization can use</p>
<p>it but the rest of the question</p>
<p>is that they will require xr</p>
<p>applications so that's ar</p>
<p>vr on all of that absolutely so the same</p>
<p>way that we are doing</p>
<p>things like unity and the others</p>
<p>expanding the business capability on a</p>
<p>continuous basis we have a team that</p>
<p>just look at this</p>
<p>is how do we how do we create</p>
<p>more um whether i just want to see the</p>
<p>ar and vr on my</p>
<p>on my mobile device or is it something</p>
<p>that i want to put a headset like a</p>
<p>hololens or which right now</p>
<p>it's not that industrial but you know</p>
<p>there's a lot of development happening</p>
<p>in that and</p>
<p>again in the next 10 years if we look</p>
<p>back</p>
<p>10 years from now we will we will see</p>
<p>very different technologies</p>
<p>and yes a package business capability</p>
<p>around arvr</p>
<p>is a critical aspect of that so for us</p>
<p>and there are standards emerging around</p>
<p>that so we will</p>
<p>for us the focus is to make sure that we</p>
<p>continue the composability across the</p>
<p>whole</p>
<p>a continuum of of user experiences that</p>
<p>are out there</p>
<p>great question thank you very much also</p>
<p>appreciate everyone's time on this</p>
<p>if anyone's got more questions if you</p>
<p>have a question around this please feel</p>
<p>free to</p>
<p>reach out to me i'm happy to address any</p>
<p>questions</p>
<p>on this again have a look at the</p>
<p>demonstrations on our website</p>
<p>and look forward to seeing you on a</p>
<p>continuation of this topic</p>
<p>in future webinars thank you very much</p>
<p>appreciate your time</p>
