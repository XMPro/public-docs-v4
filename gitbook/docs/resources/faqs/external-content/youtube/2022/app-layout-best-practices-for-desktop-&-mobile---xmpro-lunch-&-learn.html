<summary>Transcript</summary>hello everybody and welcome to a lunch
<p>and learning session today my name is</p>
<p>gavin green and today we're going to go</p>
<p>through app layout best practices how to</p>
<p>get it working for desktop and mobile</p>
<p>let's jump in</p>
<p>so today's tech session is around</p>
<p>responsible app layout</p>
<p>now</p>
<p>what do i mean by that so we first need</p>
<p>to get some basics</p>
<p>so a responsive web design is creating a</p>
<p>web page</p>
<p>that looks good on a variety of</p>
<p>different devices</p>
<p>without having to configure</p>
<p>them each independently or separately i</p>
<p>need to be able to open it on my desktop</p>
<p>on my tablet on my phone and work</p>
<p>through it interchangeably as well</p>
<p>so it really is how does it</p>
<p>automatically adjust</p>
<p>to different screens as well as the</p>
<p>different</p>
<p>different viewports</p>
<p>we're going to go through some concepts</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>when you're configuring</p>
<p>for a desktop</p>
<p>you can use all the elements in the</p>
<p>toolbox</p>
<p>when you start transitioning over to a</p>
<p>tablet or even to an iphone</p>
<p>you need to start</p>
<p>working through some decisions on which</p>
<p>design elements to show does it make</p>
<p>sense to show</p>
<p>do we need to adjust some of the</p>
<p>positioning how to use the responsive ui</p>
<p>configuration inside the app designer</p>
<p>and then we'll also touch on the</p>
<p>visibility option how can we actually</p>
<p>make certain features</p>
<p>visible on the the main desktop view but</p>
<p>how can we hide those that are not</p>
<p>relevant on a mobile as an example</p>
<p>we do have some some requirements</p>
<p>you obviously need access to an app</p>
<p>designer for this</p>
<p>highly suggested that you have a mobile</p>
<p>device with you</p>
<p>uh whether it's a tablet whether it is a</p>
<p>phone</p>
<p>this will help you validate the layouts</p>
<p>as we go through it</p>
<p>and lastly but</p>
<p>most importantly is who are the</p>
<p>different personas that are going to use</p>
<p>the layout that you're configuring</p>
<p>people who are constantly on their</p>
<p>phones all the time people who</p>
<p>transition between the two of them it's</p>
<p>good to have a high level idea of who</p>
<p>that persona is</p>
<p>as well as some of the user stories that</p>
<p>will help guide you in what's the most</p>
<p>important information to show</p>
<p>as well as what can you keep on the</p>
<p>desktop what can you lose as soon as you</p>
<p>shrink your real estate onto a a browser</p>
<p>on a phone</p>
<p>and lastly what type of skill level are</p>
<p>we looking at to to configure this and</p>
<p>put this together</p>
<p>this is very beginner friendly</p>
<p>it can start going into an intermediate</p>
<p>but it really is focused around</p>
<p>beginners getting to understand and work</p>
<p>through and know the different concepts</p>
<p>as we go through this</p>
<p>if you do have any questions as we're</p>
<p>going through this please post them in</p>
<p>the chat as well we'll collate them</p>
<p>and reply to them after the session</p>
<p>if we move into the software</p>
<p>the first thing we want to go to is how</p>
<p>do i actually access the mobile</p>
<p>version how do i</p>
<p>log into it where can i find it</p>
<p>so we've logged into the app designer</p>
<p>here</p>
<p>top right you'll see there is a mobile</p>
<p>icon</p>
<p>if you click that it'll bring up a</p>
<p>pane in the pane you'll see there is a</p>
<p>set of different instructions but there</p>
<p>is also a qr code in the middle</p>
<p>if you scan the qr code on either your</p>
<p>tablet or your mobile device it'll ask</p>
<p>you to log in</p>
<p>the browser and you'll have access to</p>
<p>the mobile version the mobile website is</p>
<p>a fully responsive website</p>
<p>it contains the recommendations by</p>
<p>default as well as any of the apps that</p>
<p>you've configured</p>
<p>in there as well</p>
<p>so first thing you want to do is</p>
<p>obviously</p>
<p>log in on either your tablet or log in</p>
<p>on your mobile device</p>
<p>so that you have it handy next to you</p>
<p>you can use the</p>
<p>f12 option in a browser to see what it</p>
<p>looks like</p>
<p>but it's not a true reflection of a</p>
<p>mobile interface so some of the items in</p>
<p>there will still render like the menu</p>
<p>bars etc so it's best to have a mobile</p>
<p>device with you</p>
<p>it'll allow you to validate the the</p>
<p>different settings that we have</p>
<p>if i go into a particular app and i'm</p>
<p>going to pick a app that i have</p>
<p>available</p>
<p>and i'm going to walk you through some</p>
<p>of the different items that we have for</p>
<p>it</p>
<p>so this app is initially configured to</p>
<p>be available on a desktop</p>
<p>so what that means is we have a esri map</p>
<p>in the middle here it allows me to</p>
<p>interact with it it allows me to see the</p>
<p>information i can see my asset status</p>
<p>i can see my recommendations and i've</p>
<p>got my equipment that's important to to</p>
<p>me as well</p>
<p>i have a lot of real estate here</p>
<p>it makes sense to keep this because the</p>
<p>persona is interested in indicators</p>
<p>lighting up the the map i can see my</p>
<p>overall status here</p>
<p>top right resurfacing up the</p>
<p>recommendations because they're</p>
<p>important</p>
<p>but we're also highlighting equipment</p>
<p>requiring maintenance</p>
<p>if i was to leave this</p>
<p>ui as it is right now when i was to open</p>
<p>it on my mobile it will attempt to</p>
<p>render it exactly like this and what</p>
<p>will happen is everything will start</p>
<p>rendering and will be squished here and</p>
<p>it just won't look</p>
<p>appealing to anyone that is interacting</p>
<p>with it</p>
<p>so we need to make some adjustments to</p>
<p>that so how do we actually do that</p>
<p>if i click the pencil so i have added</p>
<p>access to this particular app so i can</p>
<p>actually go in and make these changes</p>
<p>that i'm talking to yeah</p>
<p>the first thing is this app is published</p>
<p>so it won't save any of the changes but</p>
<p>i actually don't need to to do that</p>
<p>what i will be doing is i'll be making</p>
<p>use of these three icons across the top</p>
<p>here</p>
<p>as i mentioned some of the concepts that</p>
<p>we want to be going through</p>
<p>is how can i use the responsive ui</p>
<p>elements here to set up different</p>
<p>experiences if i want to</p>
<p>yet i've got exactly the same</p>
<p>application</p>
<p>i have exactly the same set of data</p>
<p>sources coming in and i have exactly the</p>
<p>same set of rules that i may have</p>
<p>configured on this particular app as</p>
<p>well for it</p>
<p>the first thing looking at this is</p>
<p>obviously</p>
<p>you have a lot of different layout</p>
<p>options here</p>
<p>on a desktop it would make sense to keep</p>
<p>an entry map</p>
<p>if i go and look at the blocks</p>
<p>you will see there's a lot of different</p>
<p>components in here as well</p>
<p>for it</p>
<p>if we look at the layout options the</p>
<p>next question to go through is what</p>
<p>makes the most sense on a tablet</p>
<p>can you keep the esri map yes you can</p>
<p>you have a lot of real estate there as</p>
<p>you start shrinking to a</p>
<p>a mobile you start asking is it relevant</p>
<p>to keep the the big energy map there</p>
<p>versus the other information</p>
<p>that we're looking at here so we've got</p>
<p>overall asset status recommendations and</p>
<p>again we've got equipment requiring</p>
<p>maintenance</p>
<p>one of the key questions to answer is</p>
<p>who's the audience that's going to</p>
<p>consume it on a device versus the the</p>
<p>desktop</p>
<p>are they interested in looking at in</p>
<p>this instance an esri map or they're</p>
<p>more interested in the recommendations</p>
<p>the overall status and maybe equipment</p>
<p>requiring maintenance as well</p>
<p>so the first thing that we want to do</p>
<p>is how can we actually</p>
<p>hide some elements</p>
<p>from the uh the different rendering so</p>
<p>on on a desktop i want to see everything</p>
<p>but on a mobile device i actually don't</p>
<p>want to see them</p>
<p>the first thing where we can do that is</p>
<p>we can actually make use of</p>
<p>the if i go up into the box</p>
<p>we can make use of the appearance</p>
<p>there's a visible option</p>
<p>most likely when you've configured this</p>
<p>it will say visible is true</p>
<p>for most of the apps that you've created</p>
<p>now what you'll notice is if i go into</p>
<p>the page layers i can actually see all</p>
<p>the different layers that i have</p>
<p>configured</p>
<p>and page layers becomes a little</p>
<p>important when you are trying to work</p>
<p>out the different orientation what's</p>
<p>going to flow above in the middle and</p>
<p>below as well</p>
<p>if i click on the esri map itself</p>
<p>can i just hide the esri map yes you can</p>
<p>there's nothing stopping you from hiding</p>
<p>the actual control itself</p>
<p>however by doing that</p>
<p>you still got this container that sits</p>
<p>around it and you still have the heading</p>
<p>that's going to show</p>
<p>so you actually don't want to just hide</p>
<p>that particular control</p>
<p>what you want to do is you want to have</p>
<p>a look at how are the different layers</p>
<p>set up in here</p>
<p>so we have a vertical stack layout you</p>
<p>can see as i click on it on the right in</p>
<p>the blue it's going to highlight</p>
<p>everything that is selected for me</p>
<p>if i go to the first box you'll see</p>
<p>that's the one which is containing my</p>
<p>history map</p>
<p>that's the one that has a heading that's</p>
<p>the one that has a asrie map</p>
<p>that is the one that i actually want to</p>
<p>hide if i'm going to view this on a</p>
<p>mobile device</p>
<p>so what we want to do is just click that</p>
<p>so we're going to select that</p>
<p>we're then going to go into the block</p>
<p>properties as i mentioned by default</p>
<p>yours is probably going to be set to</p>
<p>true</p>
<p>as its normal state you can go and set</p>
<p>this to false</p>
<p>however it's going to be false on pretty</p>
<p>much all three uh desktop browser as</p>
<p>well as mobile device</p>
<p>if you click the icon on the left where</p>
<p>you see an a so currently we're in</p>
<p>static mode if i click that once</p>
<p>it's going to turn into dynamic value</p>
<p>if i click that a third time it's</p>
<p>actually going to bring a quick</p>
<p>expression out for me as well</p>
<p>if i click into the middle it's going to</p>
<p>bring up the quick expression and allow</p>
<p>me to edit it so if i delete everything</p>
<p>that's in there</p>
<p>by default this is what yours is going</p>
<p>to look like if you go into the quick</p>
<p>expression</p>
<p>so what we want to do is we want to put</p>
<p>a condition in here</p>
<p>we want to put a condition that if the</p>
<p>browser is identified as mobile we want</p>
<p>to hide this particular block</p>
<p>if it's not mobile we want to render it</p>
<p>paranormal</p>
<p>so first thing we're going to do is</p>
<p>under functions we are going to look</p>
<p>under logical</p>
<p>here is our if statement</p>
<p>on the right it will walk you through</p>
<p>how you can actually configure that but</p>
<p>for now if we just double click that</p>
<p>it'll start filling it in for us across</p>
<p>the top</p>
<p>if i click into the first area we're now</p>
<p>going to go to constants under constants</p>
<p>you'll see a few fields</p>
<p>we have an is mobile and we have an is</p>
<p>desktop</p>
<p>both of these are used</p>
<p>specifically</p>
<p>to show or hide</p>
<p>or to do various calculations if you</p>
<p>want to</p>
<p>or to move things around on the ui in</p>
<p>the different modes</p>
<p>if i double click is mobile</p>
<p>it'll fill that in for me so what we're</p>
<p>filling in here is</p>
<p>if the render mode is mobile</p>
<p>we want this to not displace we're going</p>
<p>to set that to false otherwise the</p>
<p>default is going to be true</p>
<p>if you click out of that</p>
<p>it'll keep that</p>
<p>expression configured for you</p>
<p>so as we walk through this</p>
<p>when we open up this app</p>
<p>the first thing it's going to do is it's</p>
<p>going to tell this app i'm rendered on a</p>
<p>mobile device or i'm rendered on a</p>
<p>desktop</p>
<p>if it is rendered on a desktop</p>
<p>it'll render as true</p>
<p>if it's not</p>
<p>it'll set this to false which means this</p>
<p>entire block is not going to render</p>
<p>itself</p>
<p>if you were to unpublish this app and</p>
<p>save it</p>
<p>you need to open it on your mobile</p>
<p>device to be able to view it</p>
<p>i mentioned earlier that you can</p>
<p>actually open this up using your f12</p>
<p>now for those who are not aware</p>
<p>f12 allows you to view</p>
<p>the the actual layout of this particular</p>
<p>page and there is an option in here</p>
<p>where you can go into it and you can</p>
<p>change it to specific</p>
<p>however this is just an emulation</p>
<p>as you can see here what it does it</p>
<p>still keeps the heading and it still</p>
<p>keeps the bar here</p>
<p>it'll give you a good indication of</p>
<p>things which have been made visible and</p>
<p>things which are</p>
<p>still visible i.e not hidden</p>
<p>but you'll notice that you do have a few</p>
<p>styling items to</p>
<p>to work through here</p>
<p>it gives you a good indication so here</p>
<p>you'll see exactly the same</p>
<p>form if i was to switch that off and go</p>
<p>back to the main desktop</p>
<p>there is my map view here is my overall</p>
<p>status my recommendations and my</p>
<p>equipment requiring maintenance</p>
<p>if i was to go into that</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>select for instance an iphone</p>
<p>and i was to switch that around what</p>
<p>you'll notice here is some of the</p>
<p>styling is not configured</p>
<p>but my map is not actually rendering</p>
<p>so it knows between the different modes</p>
<p>when to render something and when not to</p>
<p>render something</p>
<p>so the first thing is to identify which</p>
<p>of the different we call them blocks</p>
<p>which of these different components in</p>
<p>here should be visible on a mobile or a</p>
<p>tablet</p>
<p>or a desktop</p>
<p>you may want to change up what you're</p>
<p>showing instead of showing a map here</p>
<p>you may have another controller in mind</p>
<p>that you want to make visible when</p>
<p>someone is interacting with it on a</p>
<p>mobile the other thing to consider on a</p>
<p>mobile is you're very limited on real</p>
<p>estate so the most important thing</p>
<p>should be the ones that you see first</p>
<p>less important as you start scrolling</p>
<p>down</p>
<p>the same applies on a desktop</p>
<p>it's a good rule of thumb to make sure</p>
<p>that the most important things you're</p>
<p>trying to illustrate to the end users is</p>
<p>across the top</p>
<p>and as you start going down the page</p>
<p>they're still relevant but the</p>
<p>importance is not as great</p>
<p>now why am i mentioning that</p>
<p>if we go back into the edit mode here</p>
<p>so we've now hidden</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>entire esri map</p>
<p>so the map is now not visible however we</p>
<p>may want to adjust</p>
<p>and move around</p>
<p>the the remaining elements so as soon as</p>
<p>you open it up the most important things</p>
<p>at the top so how do we do that across</p>
<p>the top</p>
<p>by default</p>
<p>it'll have the desktop</p>
<p>selected</p>
<p>if i was to click the phone</p>
<p>what you'll notice is it actually swaps</p>
<p>to a</p>
<p>much shorter</p>
<p>amount of space that i can configure but</p>
<p>you'll also notice that quite a few of</p>
<p>these fields have moved around a bit</p>
<p>so now</p>
<p>my esri map is not top left</p>
<p>it's been adjusted</p>
<p>my equipment requiring maintenance is</p>
<p>moved to the top</p>
<p>so if i open this up on a mobile i get a</p>
<p>different visual experience but it's</p>
<p>exactly the same app so how did we</p>
<p>actually do this</p>
<p>if i go to the tablet view</p>
<p>you'll see the tablet view</p>
<p>mirrors what we have on the desktop</p>
<p>so if i go back to the desktop view</p>
<p>and i go to the tablet view you'll see</p>
<p>they mirror each other</p>
<p>the first thing that we want to do is we</p>
<p>want to adjust and move some things</p>
<p>around</p>
<p>the reason i've picked the</p>
<p>the tablet view i've just got more real</p>
<p>estate that i can show you the impact of</p>
<p>the the changes we're going to make</p>
<p>again as i mentioned earlier page layers</p>
<p>allows you to move things around that</p>
<p>makes sense</p>
<p>important to to understand is in the</p>
<p>layout if i was to click the vertical</p>
<p>stack layout now what vertical stack</p>
<p>layout is if you go to blocks</p>
<p>you'll see under layout</p>
<p>one of these</p>
<p>is actually called vertical stack or</p>
<p>horizontal stack</p>
<p>if i was to click</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>and i go to its properties you'll notice</p>
<p>there is no visible option there</p>
<p>they do not have any block property</p>
<p>options on them</p>
<p>you need to make sure that if this is</p>
<p>something that you do want to move</p>
<p>around shuffle around</p>
<p>make visible or not it needs to be</p>
<p>within a container of sorts which is why</p>
<p>i have the box in here</p>
<p>if i now click the box</p>
<p>and i go to its block properties you'll</p>
<p>see i have an appearance</p>
<p>that is what we did with the entire so</p>
<p>if i click the</p>
<p>the map box this is the one that we</p>
<p>configured that is visible on as well</p>
<p>now why is this important</p>
<p>it's important to understand</p>
<p>as we're going to adjust some of the</p>
<p>flex layout now we're going to start</p>
<p>moving some of the field elements around</p>
<p>what you'll notice is because i've got</p>
<p>this selected my screen is currently</p>
<p>split</p>
<p>into a two-thirds to one-third</p>
<p>the one i've got selected is two-thirds</p>
<p>if i select the other one you'll see</p>
<p>it's one-third</p>
<p>if i want to move items around my</p>
<p>horizontal layout</p>
<p>i'm going to go to the first one</p>
<p>i'm going to go to the second one</p>
<p>i want to actually put</p>
<p>these two fields above</p>
<p>my my map</p>
<p>so we're hiding the map</p>
<p>so i don't actually need this field</p>
<p>anymore but as soon as you open the</p>
<p>phone for the first time i actually want</p>
<p>my</p>
<p>equipment requiring maintenance to be</p>
<p>right at the top currently it's bottom</p>
<p>bottom right so how do we move that</p>
<p>around</p>
<p>if i go to the horizontal</p>
<p>and i go to the box one and i go to my</p>
<p>box two</p>
<p>again on the horizontal</p>
<p>we are going to go into the block</p>
<p>styling</p>
<p>and we're going to go into flex layout</p>
<p>flex layout allows me to adjust how</p>
<p>the different elements react in relation</p>
<p>to each other</p>
<p>we do have a video on our youtube</p>
<p>learning channel which goes into a lot</p>
<p>more detail around flex</p>
<p>i highly recommend you watch that we're</p>
<p>just going to scratch the surface on</p>
<p>flex</p>
<p>right now</p>
<p>so what you'll notice here is the</p>
<p>direction is going left to right we're</p>
<p>actually going to adjust the direction</p>
<p>north to south top to bottom</p>
<p>so the first thing that you'll notice is</p>
<p>we've still got our map</p>
<p>we still got our overall status but now</p>
<p>instead of that recommendation equipment</p>
<p>required maintenance being on the right</p>
<p>it's now at the bottom</p>
<p>if you're unsure</p>
<p>we can go back</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>the the desktop view this is where we</p>
<p>started</p>
<p>if i go back into</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>tablet view this is where we've got to</p>
<p>so again what we did</p>
<p>is we've gone into</p>
<p>the container around those two boxes and</p>
<p>we're just adjusting its flex loud we're</p>
<p>just adjusting how these are being</p>
<p>rendered in relation to each other</p>
<p>what we can do as well is we can</p>
<p>actually reverse that</p>
<p>i'm more interested in equipment</p>
<p>requiring maintenance be near the top</p>
<p>overall asset status</p>
<p>that could be a little bit further down</p>
<p>on my page so we've actually reversed</p>
<p>the two of these</p>
<p>remember</p>
<p>this box in the middle here is going to</p>
<p>be hidden as soon as this renders on a</p>
<p>tablet in this instance or on a mobile</p>
<p>device</p>
<p>if i go into this box though</p>
<p>so you'll see</p>
<p>the horizontal at the top that's the one</p>
<p>that we've adjusted the flex on</p>
<p>so instead of going left to right we</p>
<p>went top to bottom and then we reversed</p>
<p>that so now bottom to top</p>
<p>if we go into the one box here i want to</p>
<p>do the exact same thing</p>
<p>with the items inside it</p>
<p>if i go to its block styling i'm going</p>
<p>to reverse those two as well</p>
<p>so now equipment requiring maintenance</p>
<p>is going to be at the top so that's the</p>
<p>first thing i'm going to see as soon as</p>
<p>i open my tablet or i open my mobile</p>
<p>device the next thing i'm going to see</p>
<p>is a list of recommendations come</p>
<p>through there as well</p>
<p>and then the third thing i'm going to</p>
<p>see is my overall asset status coming in</p>
<p>as well</p>
<p>now what you'll notice is as you go back</p>
<p>between all the different layouts</p>
<p>it's going to remember what you've</p>
<p>configured in the different states</p>
<p>so what this means is</p>
<p>if i go into</p>
<p>my chart as an example here</p>
<p>i may want to adjust</p>
<p>again</p>
<p>the layout of this i don't want them</p>
<p>next to each other i want them on top of</p>
<p>each other</p>
<p>i can go to its block styling here and</p>
<p>again i can set that</p>
<p>up</p>
<p>what you'll notice here is i don't have</p>
<p>any padding between the two so if this</p>
<p>renders they're going to render quite</p>
<p>squashed on top of each other we want to</p>
<p>give them some breathing room</p>
<p>in this as well</p>
<p>so i can click the chart</p>
<p>and if we go to its dimension</p>
<p>i can actually give it a border at the</p>
<p>bottom</p>
<p>or we can give it a greater border</p>
<p>so now when it renders there's some</p>
<p>breathing room between the chart</p>
<p>as well as the contents underneath it</p>
<p>i can further specify because we're on</p>
<p>mobile</p>
<p>you can be a little bit more restrictive</p>
<p>on having the the heights of the charts</p>
<p>as well</p>
<p>so what should the minimum height of the</p>
<p>chart be but you can also restrict its</p>
<p>maximum height as well</p>
<p>if i go back to my desktop view</p>
<p>you'll see here this chart</p>
<p>has its desktop property set</p>
<p>if i go back into my tablet view</p>
<p>you'll see it'll have the tablet</p>
<p>property set on it as well</p>
<p>the block styling section here</p>
<p>is smart enough to know which mode are</p>
<p>you configuring your app in</p>
<p>and remembers those settings</p>
<p>so if you're configuring something for a</p>
<p>desktop which is the default you</p>
<p>configure everything as you normally</p>
<p>would</p>
<p>if you're interested in configuring</p>
<p>something for a mobile device</p>
<p>you can just click the mobile device and</p>
<p>change the look and feel the styling etc</p>
<p>as well</p>
<p>block properties the visible properties</p>
<p>the legend visible all of these you can</p>
<p>control in exactly the same fashion we</p>
<p>only touch the visible so again</p>
<p>i could make this</p>
<p>chart hidden</p>
<p>if i'm on mobile if i really wanted to</p>
<p>to do that we go into functions logical</p>
<p>double click the if statement</p>
<p>go to the first item</p>
<p>go to constants and we say is this</p>
<p>mobile</p>
<p>then visible is going to be false</p>
<p>otherwise</p>
<p>we want it to be true</p>
<p>because i've selected the chart you'll</p>
<p>notice down the bottom here we can</p>
<p>actually have a lot more control over</p>
<p>the actual component as well</p>
<p>again i can go into</p>
<p>the legend of a chart</p>
<p>and i can apply the same thing in here</p>
<p>so if we are</p>
<p>on a mobile</p>
<p>i don't want the legend</p>
<p>to be displayed if we're on a desktop i</p>
<p>do want the legend to be displayed as</p>
<p>well</p>
<p>the box that is what we set the default</p>
<p>for the actual edge remap here</p>
<p>but each different component</p>
<p>in the block properties also has</p>
<p>different options so hide series on</p>
<p>click</p>
<p>allow exports</p>
<p>so again</p>
<p>you can</p>
<p>anything that has a true or a false</p>
<p>option in here</p>
<p>you can ask the same question</p>
<p>and either enable or disable it from the</p>
<p>mobile experience</p>
<p>while we're in that mode the second area</p>
<p>you can influence is on the block</p>
<p>styling</p>
<p>typically the main items you want to</p>
<p>edit and change in here will be around</p>
<p>flex itself</p>
<p>influences everything inside a container</p>
<p>that's why if i select a vertical stack</p>
<p>layout or even if i select this vertical</p>
<p>stack layout it'll affect everything</p>
<p>that's inside that container</p>
<p>so if you want to adjust the the flex</p>
<p>layout make sure you select the parent</p>
<p>and then adjust your flex from there</p>
<p>at the same time because we're in the</p>
<p>different modes you can also change your</p>
<p>justification you can align differently</p>
<p>you can also change how you want items</p>
<p>to wrap as soon as you reach the edge of</p>
<p>the the render space or the viewport you</p>
<p>want the actual items to wrap underneath</p>
<p>each other versus vanishing into the</p>
<p>left or the right of the screen as well</p>
<p>there are different options in here on</p>
<p>topography</p>
<p>decorations and extra</p>
<p>applies to the block styling as you are</p>
<p>selecting the different modes that we're</p>
<p>going through in here</p>
<p>so if i come back here what are we</p>
<p>trying to go through here</p>
<p>we're trying to make sure that when we</p>
<p>put an app together</p>
<p>we create it from a responsive app</p>
<p>perspective</p>
<p>key item to to ask whenever you put an</p>
<p>app together is who's the end audience</p>
<p>who's the persona that's going to be</p>
<p>consuming and interacting with the app</p>
<p>is that audience mobile</p>
<p>first is that audience tablet first was</p>
<p>that audience</p>
<p>desktop first or a combination</p>
<p>second thing to consider is for each of</p>
<p>those different display modes</p>
<p>what ui elements make the most sense</p>
<p>does it make sense to have a for</p>
<p>instance</p>
<p>grid</p>
<p>all the way to a</p>
<p>mobile device versus only presenting the</p>
<p>information that is applicable</p>
<p>or having a full 3d unity rendering on a</p>
<p>tablet that takes up two-thirds of the</p>
<p>space and you have to scroll all the way</p>
<p>down to find what's important and</p>
<p>relevant</p>
<p>to to view so some of the key items to</p>
<p>consider is really around</p>
<p>what information do we need to display</p>
<p>on the different modes</p>
<p>and then using the visual responsive ui</p>
<p>side how can you configure those without</p>
<p>having to configure different apps</p>
<p>across the top you have your three</p>
<p>different modes</p>
<p>you have your tablet</p>
<p>you have your mobile device and the</p>
<p>default is</p>
<p>to the desktop</p>
<p>each of these three</p>
<p>allows you to change the block styling</p>
<p>that is applicable to that particular</p>
<p>mode that you selected</p>
<p>the other thing that you can do is if</p>
<p>you go into the block properties</p>
<p>you can start using the quick</p>
<p>expressions</p>
<p>along with the</p>
<p>constant field either is mobile or is</p>
<p>desktop</p>
<p>you can use these in any of the</p>
<p>expressions we'll touch expressions and</p>
<p>variables in a future lunch and learn as</p>
<p>well</p>
<p>where you could use these in specific</p>
<p>calculations or a lot more advanced ui</p>
<p>configuration</p>
<p>for now you can use them around</p>
<p>displaying the visibility of components</p>
<p>or enabling certain features on those</p>
<p>components as well</p>
<p>thank you for the time today</p>
<p>and for attending our lunch and learn</p>
<p>if you've got any questions please post</p>
<p>them into the the questions section</p>
<p>we'll collate them afterwards and we'll</p>
<p>report them back for for everyone to</p>
<p>view as well</p>
<p>thank you have a great day</p>
<p>you</p>
