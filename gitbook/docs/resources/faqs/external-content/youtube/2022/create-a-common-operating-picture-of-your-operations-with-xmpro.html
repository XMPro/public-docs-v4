<summary>Transcript</summary>changing from a reactive to a
<p>prescriptive way of working is one of</p>
<p>the biggest challenges for large</p>
<p>complex asset intensive organizations</p>
<p>like yours</p>
<p>enabling your own subject matter experts</p>
<p>to create an integrated common operating</p>
<p>picture that is strategically aligned</p>
<p>with your business objectives is the</p>
<p>only way to manage your operations in</p>
<p>real time at scale</p>
<p>you already have existing</p>
<p>complex infrastructure with fixed and</p>
<p>mobile assets and production facilities</p>
<p>that are in most instances</p>
<p>already instrumented with sensors plc's</p>
<p>and automation systems</p>
<p>these assets with sensors and iot</p>
<p>capabilities</p>
<p>generate a whole lot of signals and data</p>
<p>in near real time you also have many</p>
<p>disparate industrial and business</p>
<p>systems to capture store and analyze</p>
<p>these signals</p>
<p>and machine-borne data from your assets</p>
<p>typical systems in your organization may</p>
<p>vary from historians eam and erp systems</p>
<p>operational databases data lakes and a</p>
<p>plethora of other third party analytics</p>
<p>and engineering systems</p>
<p>these systems not only get signals and</p>
<p>data from the assets but also from the</p>
<p>transactional information from the</p>
<p>people in your business the new</p>
<p>generation business processes that</p>
<p>enable them</p>
<p>and the process automation needed to</p>
<p>manage this at scale</p>
<p>this is the real operational landscape</p>
<p>for your organization and many others</p>
<p>like you</p>
<p>changing from a reactive mode of</p>
<p>operation to prescriptive way that</p>
<p>includes predicting key events and then</p>
<p>advising the best course of action under</p>
<p>the current operating conditions</p>
<p>require a different way of finding and</p>
<p>responding to real-time events as they</p>
<p>happen</p>
<p>or are predicted to happen</p>
<p>you can't just rely on the alarms and</p>
<p>alerts from all the multitudes of</p>
<p>different systems that each notify you</p>
<p>in various modes on different platforms</p>
<p>or apps</p>
<p>and expect that</p>
<p>existing business processes can support</p>
<p>business users who</p>
<p>are already</p>
<p>stressed and have limited capacity</p>
<p>for them to be able to respond</p>
<p>effectively to this fire hose of the</p>
<p>alarm of alarms</p>
<p>changing from a reactive to a</p>
<p>prescriptive mode of operation requires</p>
<p>an integrated and</p>
<p>automated common operating picture such</p>
<p>as used in military and emergency</p>
<p>response</p>
<p>scenarios</p>
<p>now creating such a common operating</p>
<p>picture requires first finding the key</p>
<p>events that are happening or likely to</p>
<p>happen from all the millions of signals</p>
<p>and data points from these sensors plcs</p>
<p>and automation systems on your assets</p>
<p>and the information from your internal</p>
<p>business systems and then also</p>
<p>environmental signals from external</p>
<p>systems such as weather predictions</p>
<p>real-time commodity prices and other</p>
<p>and others to name a few</p>
<p>examples data streams provide a visual</p>
<p>way of connecting</p>
<p>disparate data sources using a library</p>
<p>of hundreds of integration connectors to</p>
<p>take the millions of signals and data</p>
<p>points and find the key events that you</p>
<p>are interested in</p>
<p>these events include asset performance</p>
<p>and utilization events such as</p>
<p>production maintenance quality safety</p>
<p>and lately esg events</p>
<p>the data streams identify these events</p>
<p>in real time by adding context from</p>
<p>existing business systems and applies</p>
<p>some form of analytic to this streaming</p>
<p>data</p>
<p>this analytic can be as simple as a</p>
<p>basic filter or as advanced as a neural</p>
<p>network ai model for example</p>
<p>it enables subject matter experts to</p>
<p>identify specific events of interest</p>
<p>and which is based on their knowledge of</p>
<p>your equipment and your operations</p>
<p>the next step is then</p>
<p>to make these key business events</p>
<p>accessible to the right people in your</p>
<p>business with the right information</p>
<p>at the right time</p>
<p>the xm pro app designer provides a drag</p>
<p>and drop interface for subject matter</p>
<p>experts to create a common operating</p>
<p>picture that aligns with the business</p>
<p>levers of your o of your business at all</p>
<p>levels of the organization</p>
<p>this ensures</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>how you respond to these key events</p>
<p>support the strategic initiatives of</p>
<p>your organization</p>
<p>the executive perspective provides a</p>
<p>strategic view that shows the event</p>
<p>intelligence a context of current and</p>
<p>forecasted kpis and business metrics</p>
<p>at the next level or tactical level the</p>
<p>event intelligence enables planning and</p>
<p>assessment of potential impact on</p>
<p>resources while at the operational level</p>
<p>a technician has a real-time view with</p>
<p>prescriptive recommendations on how to</p>
<p>respond in an effective and timely</p>
<p>manner all three levels look at the same</p>
<p>data and the same common operating</p>
<p>picture but with different lenses</p>
<p>in this way the common operating picture</p>
<p>approach differs from the single pane of</p>
<p>glass approach as it provides multiple</p>
<p>perspectives with all the information</p>
<p>and context based on the on the</p>
<p>application or the use cases for the</p>
<p>user which may differ from one to</p>
<p>another user it is still a single pane</p>
<p>for that user but those panes may differ</p>
<p>based on the role and the level and the</p>
<p>context that is needed</p>
<p>the common operating picture transforms</p>
<p>event intelligence into real time</p>
<p>operations intelligence delivered in the</p>
<p>users context this helps</p>
<p>people manage better it enables new</p>
<p>business processes that may not have</p>
<p>have existed before and potentially</p>
<p>provide business process automation to</p>
<p>handle much of this without human</p>
<p>intervention</p>
<p>the final step to move from reactive to</p>
<p>prescriptive operations is to provide</p>
<p>prescriptive recommendations for each</p>
<p>business event that needs to be</p>
<p>responded to</p>
<p>the exam pro recommendation engine</p>
<p>provides a common way to address events</p>
<p>in this common operating picture at all</p>
<p>levels</p>
<p>similar to going to the doctor for a</p>
<p>prescription and not just for a</p>
<p>prediction of an ailment you want to</p>
<p>provide prescriptive actions based on</p>
<p>the best practices</p>
<p>from experienced frontline technicians</p>
<p>from your equipment supplies and the</p>
<p>knowledge of your subject matter experts</p>
<p>like process and reliability engineers</p>
<p>the prescription is not just predicting</p>
<p>what is likely to happen but how to</p>
<p>respond how to mitigate risks and</p>
<p>potentially how to exploit an</p>
<p>opportunity</p>
<p>the exim pro recommendations provide a</p>
<p>consistent user interface at all levels</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>at all perspectives from this common</p>
<p>operating picture it is the same</p>
<p>experience at at the strategic level at</p>
<p>the tactical and operational levels</p>
<p>it further has the capability to</p>
<p>integrate alarms and alerts from</p>
<p>hundreds of third-party systems that</p>
<p>your organization want you to track</p>
<p>right now</p>
<p>it is possible to bring in all of those</p>
<p>in a consistent interface with this</p>
<p>approach to reduce the noise from all</p>
<p>the alarms and alert systems</p>
<p>and it also provides the same</p>
<p>prescriptive approach on how to best</p>
<p>address them</p>
<p>the prescriptive recommendations close</p>
<p>the loop on</p>
<p>responding to key events in the right</p>
<p>way at the right time</p>
<p>it is the automated event advisor that</p>
<p>provides guidance visibility</p>
<p>and accountability consistently across</p>
<p>all levels of your organization</p>
<p>this common operating</p>
<p>picture is a is an intelligent digital</p>
<p>twin approach that provides always on</p>
<p>situational awareness with prescriptive</p>
<p>guidance to empower your smartest people</p>
<p>to pull the</p>
<p>the levers that align with your business</p>
<p>strategy at all levels of your business</p>
<p>the common operating picture further</p>
<p>reduces the risk of being blindsided by</p>
<p>key business events that are happening</p>
<p>or likely to happen</p>
<p>and finally this common operating</p>
<p>picture provides</p>
<p>the opportunity to improve</p>
<p>accountability and closes the feedback</p>
<p>loop</p>
<p>that provides the visibility and</p>
<p>opportunity to learn as an organization</p>
