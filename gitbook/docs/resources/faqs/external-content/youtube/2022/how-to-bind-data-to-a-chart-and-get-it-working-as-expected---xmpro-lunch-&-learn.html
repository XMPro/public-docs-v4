<summary>Transcript</summary>hi all and welcome to another lunch and
<p>learning session</p>
<p>in today's session we're going to go</p>
<p>through how to bind data to a chart</p>
<p>and get working as expected</p>
<p>so what we're going to cover is we</p>
<p>covered this in a prior lunch and</p>
<p>learned around data caching</p>
<p>and how we can actually receive data in</p>
<p>the app designer from a data stream</p>
<p>there are some different caching options</p>
<p>we're going to explore some of them</p>
<p>today around charts specifically and</p>
<p>we're going to touch on a few of the</p>
<p>charting items to make the</p>
<p>configurations easier there as well</p>
<p>some of the concepts we're going to</p>
<p>touch on</p>
<p>some action agents connectors we're</p>
<p>going to also touch on cache all or per</p>
<p>entity again</p>
<p>you will need access to the app designer</p>
<p>you're going to need access to the data</p>
<p>stream designer and you also need an</p>
<p>idea of what type of data it is that</p>
<p>you're looking to to display</p>
<p>skill level for this</p>
<p>we're still at beginner friendly and</p>
<p>intermediate as well</p>
<p>if we move over into the actual app</p>
<p>what we covered here last time is from a</p>
<p>data stream perspective how do we make</p>
<p>the data available</p>
<p>and visual on a app</p>
<p>or something that we generated in a data</p>
<p>stream so previously in a data stream we</p>
<p>configured everything and we only had</p>
<p>the one block we can ignore this one for</p>
<p>the moment</p>
<p>you can just move that down over there</p>
<p>so we were generating some data rounding</p>
<p>it and then we were sending it to an app</p>
<p>if i open up the configuration for this</p>
<p>we've got the</p>
<p>app designer settings we have the cash</p>
<p>amount for entity and we have asset and</p>
<p>asset number coming through in here as</p>
<p>well</p>
<p>now typically how you would actually</p>
<p>configure this is you would set this to</p>
<p>one and we want to cache it per entity</p>
<p>our entity is going to be asset number</p>
<p>and we've got our point asset number</p>
<p>coming in the bottom there</p>
<p>if i apply that and save that</p>
<p>if i click the publish and we go into</p>
<p>the live view we can see the generate</p>
<p>data which is coming through from my</p>
<p>event simulator and we can see the send</p>
<p>data to app down the bottom there as</p>
<p>well</p>
<p>so all we've done is we've configured it</p>
<p>to allow one record to come through</p>
<p>and that is significant now i'll explain</p>
<p>why when we get to the chart</p>
<p>configuration</p>
<p>we then have a different</p>
<p>endpoint here pointing to the exopro app</p>
<p>i'll come back to that for now we have a</p>
<p>generate</p>
<p>we've got a calculated field just</p>
<p>helping us clean up the data we're just</p>
<p>doing some rounding</p>
<p>the rounding helps us from the</p>
<p>display here to make sure we don't have</p>
<p>too many decimal points coming in you</p>
<p>can also round inside the app designer</p>
<p>as well</p>
<p>and then we're sending the data to the</p>
<p>app</p>
<p>so if i go to the</p>
<p>design view of this particular app</p>
<p>at the top</p>
<p>we have the data source which is bound</p>
<p>to the lab data and that's how we're</p>
<p>getting our information coming in</p>
<p>for it so the temperature is bound to</p>
<p>the temperature the vibration is bound</p>
<p>to the vibration field same with the</p>
<p>reading</p>
<p>reading number and then just the asset</p>
<p>number coming in here as well</p>
<p>so that's just bound to the data source</p>
<p>allows us to present the data</p>
<p>one key thing to remember is if i go to</p>
<p>its properties here</p>
<p>and we open up the configuration for</p>
<p>that xm pro</p>
<p>we set its caching to one we've also</p>
<p>told it to cash for entity and we're</p>
<p>using the asset number to do that with</p>
<p>now what happens is if we go to the</p>
<p>block section</p>
<p>under visualization you'll find the</p>
<p>chart so let's drag the chart to the top</p>
<p>let's just change the data so we'll just</p>
<p>say live</p>
<p>lementry</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>google had this fill there</p>
<p>and now we've got a base chart</p>
<p>coming in</p>
<p>the next thing that we want to do is we</p>
<p>want to make sure that we have a data</p>
<p>source for it</p>
<p>so let us get rid of this data source</p>
<p>here</p>
<p>so currently we've only got one data</p>
<p>source it's the data source which is</p>
<p>providing us information that we are</p>
<p>displaying on this card on the top left</p>
<p>if i click the pencil</p>
<p>you'll see that it is bound to</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>send data to app in the luncheon area at</p>
<p>the top here</p>
<p>so it is bound specifically to</p>
<p>this end point here</p>
<p>what we're going to do is we're going to</p>
<p>bind the chart to exactly the same</p>
<p>endpoint</p>
<p>and we are going to see what does that</p>
<p>actually do when we want to render that</p>
<p>data on the other side in the actual app</p>
<p>itself so we click on the chart let's go</p>
<p>to the block properties you'll see that</p>
<p>the data source will highlight and tell</p>
<p>you that it hasn't been selected</p>
<p>if you click the drop down we'll see</p>
<p>live data come in there</p>
<p>as soon as we do that we save it'll drop</p>
<p>the required field off</p>
<p>the next thing is we want to create a</p>
<p>series</p>
<p>if you click the plus it'll open up a</p>
<p>section which is going to allow you to</p>
<p>create a new series for charts</p>
<p>charts need series so that you can</p>
<p>attach the data to them so you can see</p>
<p>for instance temperature</p>
<p>driving on driving or you want to see</p>
<p>pressure and flow or humidity and</p>
<p>ambient temperature together you may</p>
<p>want to see a few different</p>
<p>series on the same axis</p>
<p>that is what we're trying to add</p>
<p>on the side over here</p>
<p>if i scroll down though</p>
<p>my x-axis</p>
<p>is not going to allow me to select asset</p>
<p>number and it's not going to allow me to</p>
<p>select timestamp</p>
<p>if i go down to the y-axis axis will</p>
<p>however what i'm looking to do is i'm</p>
<p>looking to use the time stamp</p>
<p>if i go back in here you'll see there is</p>
<p>a timestamp field coming through i want</p>
<p>to use that timestamp field</p>
<p>for my axis</p>
<p>to do that you need to go to the access</p>
<p>and you'll see the x-axis over here is</p>
<p>set to numeric we need to change that to</p>
<p>a date time</p>
<p>and if we save those changes</p>
<p>and we now go down into the data section</p>
<p>and click plus</p>
<p>you will see that we are now able to</p>
<p>only select timestamp in the bottom so</p>
<p>we're going to select timestamp now</p>
<p>what i'm also going to do is just update</p>
<p>the color there</p>
<p>and we're just going to say this is</p>
<p>temperature</p>
<p>there are a lot of other options in here</p>
<p>we won't be able to go through all of</p>
<p>them around if you want to show the</p>
<p>legend different chart types so what</p>
<p>chart type are you looking to to</p>
<p>actually represent and visually show</p>
<p>if we scroll down</p>
<p>we have created the</p>
<p>timestamp we found that we are now going</p>
<p>to go for the temperature</p>
<p>everything else we can leave</p>
<p>as default click apply and close</p>
<p>and we can click save</p>
<p>now if we go back to our app and we</p>
<p>refresh the app</p>
<p>you'll see we're still getting the the</p>
<p>live data coming through we do have a</p>
<p>chart on the right</p>
<p>the problem with the chart though is</p>
<p>you'll notice we've only got one value</p>
<p>coming through</p>
<p>the value is correct it's the the</p>
<p>temperature value coming through here</p>
<p>but we're not actually getting a trend</p>
<p>of data coming through</p>
<p>and this is typically how people will</p>
<p>configure a chart um the first time</p>
<p>around</p>
<p>the reason for this is if you go into</p>
<p>the data stream</p>
<p>it is because we are only caching one</p>
<p>record</p>
<p>per asset</p>
<p>which means the chart only has one</p>
<p>record per asset that is actually able</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>visually display</p>
<p>so again</p>
<p>what we did in here</p>
<p>is we used exactly the same data source</p>
<p>that was bound to the top left</p>
<p>we just bound that to our chart</p>
<p>and we created the the series on that</p>
<p>and we</p>
<p>used the x-axis for the time we use the</p>
<p>y-axis for the temperature</p>
<p>we're getting the correct values come</p>
<p>through</p>
<p>but we're not actually getting a trend</p>
<p>that we're interested in so how do we</p>
<p>fix this</p>
<p>so the first thing that we have to do</p>
<p>is you'll see we have a broadcast in</p>
<p>this data stream that allows me to have</p>
<p>as many</p>
<p>endpoints after the broadcast using the</p>
<p>same payload of data</p>
<p>for different things</p>
<p>so the first one is actually used here</p>
<p>the second one is we've dragged on</p>
<p>another xm pro</p>
<p>agent</p>
<p>if i double click this one this one's</p>
<p>configured a little different</p>
<p>this one has a cache size of 20. we're</p>
<p>still caching per entity</p>
<p>however if you scroll down you'll notice</p>
<p>here under the primary key we are</p>
<p>selecting timestamp as well as asset</p>
<p>number as our primary key</p>
<p>and that's important when you're trying</p>
<p>to bind data to a chart</p>
<p>it needs to know what is the primary key</p>
<p>so that can render the data correctly</p>
<p>the second part that's different here is</p>
<p>we're increasing our cache size i'm only</p>
<p>interested in 20 records</p>
<p>for this current asset</p>
<p>versus one</p>
<p>that keeps getting replaced</p>
<p>so the first thing that we want to do is</p>
<p>we drag that on</p>
<p>we configure it</p>
<p>you can have multiple of these on a data</p>
<p>stream so the top one send data to app</p>
<p>the second one send data for chart now</p>
<p>what's very important here is to make</p>
<p>sure you name these correctly</p>
<p>this is why naming is important here as</p>
<p>well because as soon as we go into the</p>
<p>app design and what we want to do this</p>
<p>time is we want to go to the data source</p>
<p>we're not going to use live data</p>
<p>we're going to click the plus we're</p>
<p>going to create a new data source here</p>
<p>we're going to call this chart editor</p>
<p>we're going to point this to a data</p>
<p>stream and in the data stream we're</p>
<p>going to go all the way down</p>
<p>make sure i find</p>
<p>where it is it's in display data</p>
<p>so we're going to go all the way down to</p>
<p>our lunch and learn version one</p>
<p>and you'll see data for chart in here as</p>
<p>well</p>
<p>if you had not named it appropriately</p>
<p>and you just left it as a default you're</p>
<p>going to start getting x and pro app 0 x</p>
<p>and pro app 1 x and pro app 2</p>
<p>and you're not going to be</p>
<p>clear as to which end point you should</p>
<p>be selecting</p>
<p>so now we're going to select chart</p>
<p>make sure we select the live updates</p>
<p>you'll see here it'll automatically fill</p>
<p>in the primary key for me we can click</p>
<p>save</p>
<p>so all we've done there is we've added a</p>
<p>new data source</p>
<p>to the page</p>
<p>and what that's allowed us to do is we</p>
<p>can automatically bind it</p>
<p>to the the data stream</p>
<p>or to the the chart itself</p>
<p>so now if we go to the drop down and i</p>
<p>go to the chart data</p>
<p>i can leave everything else as i had it</p>
<p>and i can actually see what</p>
<p>what results this will have</p>
<p>for me</p>
<p>if we go to to that let's just click the</p>
<p>refresh</p>
<p>so all we've done in here</p>
<p>exactly the same chart configuration</p>
<p>but we bounded to the first data source</p>
<p>and that was only getting us one record</p>
<p>so we changed</p>
<p>the temperature is exactly the same so</p>
<p>you'll see that i need to remap that i</p>
<p>just changed the source of where my data</p>
<p>is actually coming from</p>
<p>however now if we go to the app</p>
<p>you'll see i have access to the data</p>
<p>coming in but i can actually see the</p>
<p>live data coming through</p>
<p>on that as well from a chart perspective</p>
<p>different question um</p>
<p>is how do i know what type of data i'm</p>
<p>getting</p>
<p>yes you can look in the live view i can</p>
<p>go through the live view here i can</p>
<p>publish my data stream</p>
<p>and i can see what's this data looking</p>
<p>like but i'm inside my app</p>
<p>um and i'm not sure if i'm getting the</p>
<p>right data or not</p>
<p>how can i actually see and just make</p>
<p>sure</p>
<p>the one way we can do that is you'll see</p>
<p>at the bottom here i've just got two</p>
<p>cards</p>
<p>i've just set their flex to a size of</p>
<p>two</p>
<p>what we're going to do in the first one</p>
<p>is we're going to drag in a grid</p>
<p>so i'm going to drag in a grid and i'm</p>
<p>going to drag and grid to the second one</p>
<p>i'm just going to save the page</p>
<p>and go to properties</p>
<p>for the first grid what we're going to</p>
<p>do here is we're going to bind that to</p>
<p>the exact same data as what is being</p>
<p>used above</p>
<p>for the second one we're going to bind</p>
<p>that to the exact same data source as</p>
<p>what has been used above</p>
<p>and let's click save</p>
<p>what that's going to allow me to do</p>
<p>is i can now see</p>
<p>the data coming in</p>
<p>across the top but i can also see the</p>
<p>raw data coming in down the bottom as</p>
<p>well</p>
<p>so if you're unsure why is my data not</p>
<p>showing</p>
<p>or it's not in the correct format or i'm</p>
<p>not 100 sure if i'm getting the correct</p>
<p>number of records that i'm expecting</p>
<p>you can just drag on a grid very simple</p>
<p>way to to actually work out and see well</p>
<p>am i getting the amount of records i'm</p>
<p>expecting this is why the chart</p>
<p>initially was only getting one record</p>
<p>that kept changing</p>
<p>um constantly</p>
<p>where now where it's bound to</p>
<p>a much bigger data source you can</p>
<p>actually see the data coming through all</p>
<p>that as well</p>
<p>because we put this on the the app all</p>
<p>you've got to do is we can just go into</p>
<p>the the app itself</p>
<p>we can just delete those two grids</p>
<p>and we can continue configuring our app</p>
<p>as we need to</p>
<p>there's a few other items on the chart</p>
<p>if we go to the property side of things</p>
<p>appearance</p>
<p>this is where you control your different</p>
<p>visibility</p>
<p>if you want to</p>
<p>enable the series on click we'll just</p>
<p>set that to true for now</p>
<p>if i go down to to data what we want to</p>
<p>do here is let's bring in</p>
<p>vibration</p>
<p>again make sure you have a palette</p>
<p>predefined</p>
<p>for for your site</p>
<p>we can then choose that as our color</p>
<p>we're going to go down</p>
<p>we're going to select timestamp and now</p>
<p>we're going to pick the vibration</p>
<p>click apply and close</p>
<p>and let's view what that actually looks</p>
<p>like</p>
<p>so now you'll see i have</p>
<p>two data points coming in however</p>
<p>they are very different scales my</p>
<p>vibration is typically in between 0.1 to</p>
<p>0.7</p>
<p>where my temperature sits</p>
<p>in the high 30s across the top</p>
<p>if i click any of these it'll actually</p>
<p>hide it off the chart</p>
<p>and allow me to view the other one as</p>
<p>i've enabled it</p>
<p>so it doesn't matter how many of these</p>
<p>options um</p>
<p>or how many of these series that you add</p>
<p>to a chart</p>
<p>if you switch them</p>
<p>and enable the ability to to hide them</p>
<p>you can hide and show as many as you</p>
<p>need to</p>
<p>however</p>
<p>we've got that data coming in on the</p>
<p>chart but we've got it on different</p>
<p>scales so you've got a few different</p>
<p>options</p>
<p>for that</p>
<p>the one is you can create a different</p>
<p>access for it or the two is you can</p>
<p>create different panes for it</p>
<p>as well</p>
<p>so i've got my one access here if i</p>
<p>create different accesses for it i can</p>
<p>go in and i can name this</p>
<p>vibration</p>
<p>i can keep everything else the same</p>
<p>for it</p>
<p>and we can say apply</p>
<p>i now have two y-axis</p>
<p>that i've got available on my chart</p>
<p>now what i can do is if i go down to the</p>
<p>bottom</p>
<p>and i go to the</p>
<p>the data section i can go to my</p>
<p>vibration</p>
<p>and i can put my vibration</p>
<p>on a different</p>
<p>y-axis</p>
<p>we can apply and close that we can save</p>
<p>all the other options we're going to</p>
<p>leave as paranormal</p>
<p>i don't need to change anything else in</p>
<p>here i can go into the vibration side</p>
<p>over here</p>
<p>display labels is fine range start</p>
<p>position that's what i'm looking for i</p>
<p>want its position to be on the right and</p>
<p>we can apply</p>
<p>that what i mean by position on the</p>
<p>right is you can get the position coming</p>
<p>through on the right or you can get the</p>
<p>position coming through on the left</p>
<p>however when you start doing that you</p>
<p>start getting some um</p>
<p>flashing etc that happens</p>
<p>both of the uh series here don't really</p>
<p>belong with each other so i want to put</p>
<p>all the vibrations with each other i</p>
<p>want to put all the temperatures with</p>
<p>each other so another way of actually</p>
<p>doing that instead of using the axis is</p>
<p>to use different panes</p>
<p>so what you can do with that is i can</p>
<p>actually start creating different panes</p>
<p>for them so if i go into my vibration</p>
<p>what i want to do here is i want to set</p>
<p>it back to the default</p>
<p>and i'm actually going to create a new</p>
<p>pane here which is what i'm going to</p>
<p>call</p>
<p>vibration</p>
<p>we're going to apply and close</p>
<p>and we're going to save that as well</p>
<p>now what that does is it will create two</p>
<p>panes for me however i need to actually</p>
<p>assign i forgot to assign that to</p>
<p>the new pane that i created</p>
<p>so again go into the block properties</p>
<p>we'll go into the data section on</p>
<p>vibration</p>
<p>and we will select the vibration pane</p>
<p>down there</p>
<p>and let's have a look what that looks</p>
<p>like</p>
<p>i've now got my data coming through</p>
<p>on two very different panes</p>
<p>um which will allow me to see both of</p>
<p>them together</p>
<p>if i really need to</p>
<p>one other item to to note those charts</p>
<p>is charts need a certain amount of space</p>
<p>before they start removing certain</p>
<p>visual elements</p>
<p>what i mean by that is</p>
<p>you'll see i'm compressed for space here</p>
<p>which means we start losing some of the</p>
<p>y-axis headings you may lose some of</p>
<p>your</p>
<p>your series if you move them to the</p>
<p>bottom so always make sure when you're</p>
<p>configuring charts you give them enough</p>
<p>space</p>
<p>for as much data as you're trying to</p>
<p>present on the screen itself</p>
<p>for this example here um if i just keep</p>
<p>it at</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>one</p>
<p>so i'm just going to go and delete the</p>
<p>one series we just want to keep it at</p>
<p>temperature let's have a look at that</p>
<p>you'll see it even though i've only got</p>
<p>one pane with data it's going to show</p>
<p>both panes</p>
<p>so again if you're configuring your</p>
<p>charts</p>
<p>and you're not using certain things</p>
<p>remove them</p>
<p>um because you will be pressed for for</p>
<p>space in them so we're going to go into</p>
<p>the series here</p>
<p>we're going to go down to the pain we're</p>
<p>going to get rid of the vibration and</p>
<p>we are then going to be back where we</p>
<p>started from where i can see everything</p>
<p>come through on my chart</p>
<p>so where we started from</p>
<p>is it starts in the data stream where</p>
<p>we're actually getting our data</p>
<p>so the first thing is on our agent we</p>
<p>had one cache</p>
<p>and we were only binding it to the asset</p>
<p>number for our primary key</p>
<p>if you were to bind this to a chart you</p>
<p>would only get one record come through</p>
<p>constantly</p>
<p>second record coming through</p>
<p>over here or second object rather</p>
<p>change its cache size to 20 so i want 20</p>
<p>of the latest records always showing</p>
<p>cash for entity means for as many</p>
<p>entities that are coming through the</p>
<p>data each of them will have 20 records</p>
<p>so if i have 40 assets each of those</p>
<p>assets will have 20 records coming</p>
<p>through for them</p>
<p>if i untick that</p>
<p>and i was to save this</p>
<p>this means i would have 20 records</p>
<p>irrespective of how many assets i have</p>
<p>as well</p>
<p>so you need an idea of what is the shape</p>
<p>of my data coming through what do i want</p>
<p>to do with it</p>
<p>and that will direct you as to which</p>
<p>options to select here</p>
<p>so we're going to cache for entity and</p>
<p>then down the bottom here the one</p>
<p>difference is we are adding timestamp to</p>
<p>the primary key and we're still using</p>
<p>our identifier as asset number</p>
<p>the next thing that we have to do</p>
<p>is inside the the app designer we had to</p>
<p>come in here and we had to add a new</p>
<p>data source</p>
<p>we can't use the the data source here</p>
<p>because that is bound to the</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>the single cache</p>
<p>so we had to create a new one</p>
<p>bound to</p>
<p>the uh the 20 cache in this instance</p>
<p>even though the chart was bound to the</p>
<p>first data source and configured you can</p>
<p>just rebind it</p>
<p>because the data the data structure is</p>
<p>exactly the same</p>
<p>there's nothing that you'll need to</p>
<p>change</p>
<p>from the actual configuration of the</p>
<p>chart specifically</p>
<p>if you're unsure if the data is not</p>
<p>matching what you're expecting not sure</p>
<p>you can use the grid option down the</p>
<p>bottom here</p>
<p>which will again allow you to see what</p>
<p>is the raw data coming through right now</p>
<p>versus what i'm actually displaying at</p>
<p>the top</p>
<p>and is it in the shape that i'm</p>
<p>expecting it</p>
<p>so i've got my timestamp</p>
<p>down the bottom i have my reading for my</p>
<p>y-axis etc</p>
<p>as always if you have any questions</p>
<p>please put them in the in the chat we'll</p>
<p>collate those and answer them</p>
<p>and send those answers out as well</p>
<p>thank you for your time today and for</p>
<p>attending another lunch</p>
