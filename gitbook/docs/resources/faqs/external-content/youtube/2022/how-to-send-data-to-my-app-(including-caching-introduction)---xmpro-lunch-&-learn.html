<summary>Transcript</summary>hi all and welcome to another lunch and
<p>learn</p>
<p>so today what we're going to go through</p>
<p>is how do i send data to my app</p>
<p>we're also going to touch on a brief</p>
<p>intro into caching</p>
<p>we'll uh we'll go through that in a</p>
<p>future lunch and learn as well</p>
<p>so today we're going to be talking</p>
<p>around apps and and data</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>first things first is what is it</p>
<p>apps have two modes where they can</p>
<p>essentially render data to</p>
<p>to the end users the one is what i would</p>
<p>call static which means when you design</p>
<p>the app it'll appear there the second is</p>
<p>what i would say is dynamic</p>
<p>so information that's going to change</p>
<p>information that gets calculated</p>
<p>information that could be from an</p>
<p>expression etc so static values are done</p>
<p>at design time</p>
<p>dynamic value is either provided now</p>
<p>there's a few mechanisms of how you can</p>
<p>provide it we'll touch on both of them</p>
<p>one is through a data stream</p>
<p>and the second is a connector inside the</p>
<p>app designer</p>
<p>we'll also touch on caching so when you</p>
<p>do caching in a data stream</p>
<p>it is how often and how much data should</p>
<p>be cached that is made available to the</p>
<p>app</p>
<p>when it is rendering</p>
<p>some of the concepts we're going to</p>
<p>touch uh example action agent that'll be</p>
<p>the first one with inside a data stream</p>
<p>the second is going to be connectors</p>
<p>inside the app designer</p>
<p>we'll also touch on briefly caching all</p>
<p>or per an entity</p>
<p>some basic requirements that you're</p>
<p>going to need</p>
<p>it's going to</p>
<p>require access to the app designer</p>
<p>access to the data stream designer and</p>
<p>you need a basic idea of what data is</p>
<p>that you're looking to to display so</p>
<p>what information are you looking to</p>
<p>present to the screen</p>
<p>and where do you want it to be how do</p>
<p>you want to access it is any filters etc</p>
<p>skill level for this we're still in the</p>
<p>beginner friendly area</p>
<p>it can start to go into the intermediate</p>
<p>area</p>
<p>as well</p>
<p>so first area is let's jump into the</p>
<p>actual software itself</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>before we can actually start tying data</p>
<p>to to an app let's go and create</p>
<p>ourselves a new app</p>
<p>we're just going to call this</p>
<p>lunch and learn for today</p>
<p>we're going to put it into</p>
<p>my sandbox</p>
<p>and we're going to keep everything else</p>
<p>as the default</p>
<p>now if i go into this actual app itself</p>
<p>and i try and launch it it's going to</p>
<p>not give me anything</p>
<p>it's going to be bare basics there's not</p>
<p>much information in here</p>
<p>as well</p>
<p>now what i can start doing is i can</p>
<p>start going through here and i can start</p>
<p>configuring information</p>
<p>so let's say i want to to actually</p>
<p>create</p>
<p>some additional columns</p>
<p>i can do that</p>
<p>if i want the first one to be</p>
<p>asset information i can just double</p>
<p>click and change that information there</p>
<p>if i now want to start bringing in um</p>
<p>a little bit more</p>
<p>like dragging a box into there</p>
<p>i can now go back and from layouts i'm</p>
<p>going to drag in a stack layer and bring</p>
<p>that into the other side as well so you</p>
<p>configure your form exactly the same way</p>
<p>as you would have previously</p>
<p>however now what you can start doing is</p>
<p>when you start bringing information into</p>
<p>the screen here</p>
<p>so i could very well call this asset</p>
<p>number</p>
<p>and if i go and duplicate that and i'm</p>
<p>just going to change the flex so that we</p>
<p>go from left to right</p>
<p>so i can see that</p>
<p>i can come into the asset number</p>
<p>and i can rename it from a static</p>
<p>perspective and if i go and render the</p>
<p>screen</p>
<p>you'll see as asset number will come</p>
<p>through so you can very quickly create</p>
<p>static information on a screen however</p>
<p>that's not very useful</p>
<p>most of the information you want to have</p>
<p>changed so you need to pass this</p>
<p>information through to the form</p>
<p>so that you can actually access it and</p>
<p>make it available</p>
<p>so we're just going to go back into the</p>
<p>edit mode for this particular app we'll</p>
<p>come back to to the app itself</p>
<p>so the first area of where datic is</p>
<p>made available to an application</p>
<p>is inside the data stream designer</p>
<p>i've got an example</p>
<p>here but i'll show you how we can</p>
<p>actually create one</p>
<p>so for this particular example</p>
<p>we are using the event simulator to</p>
<p>generate some data so we've got specific</p>
<p>data that we're interested in</p>
<p>we are then creating</p>
<p>some asset numbers we are rounding it to</p>
<p>make sure that when we get to the ui</p>
<p>side that the information is consistent</p>
<p>two decimals three etcetera</p>
<p>if you don't round here</p>
<p>you can still round inside the app</p>
<p>designer</p>
<p>then you start going into</p>
<p>the expressions on an actual data source</p>
<p>we'll start covering that in a in a</p>
<p>future session as well</p>
<p>we're then going to broadcast and then</p>
<p>we publish to an app</p>
<p>however what i'm going to do with this</p>
<p>example</p>
<p>is i'm going to</p>
<p>clone it</p>
<p>and we're going to configure it</p>
<p>for different bits and pieces</p>
<p>so for now what i'm going to get rid of</p>
<p>is the last two pieces to my data stream</p>
<p>it does not matter where your data is</p>
<p>coming from there's a lot of different</p>
<p>listeners of where my information coming</p>
<p>from to the point i made earlier</p>
<p>you need to have at least an idea of</p>
<p>what data are we trying to present on</p>
<p>the form</p>
<p>what shape should that data be and where</p>
<p>is it coming from do i need to join data</p>
<p>from different data streams etc</p>
<p>if i were to run this particular data</p>
<p>stream now</p>
<p>and i go into my live view</p>
<p>and i bring the rounding and i bring my</p>
<p>generate data</p>
<p>up</p>
<p>you'll see my values will come through</p>
<p>if i expand that</p>
<p>i can see the generate column and i can</p>
<p>see the rounding column so my data is</p>
<p>flowing through my particular data</p>
<p>stream</p>
<p>however it is not available</p>
<p>on my upside</p>
<p>um i can't actually view it or see it</p>
<p>now how i know that is i'm looking for</p>
<p>lunch and learn from a data stream</p>
<p>perspective so if i go back to the app</p>
<p>now</p>
<p>how we bind data to an app</p>
<p>is on the page data side of things</p>
<p>if i scroll all the way to the left</p>
<p>you'll see there is app data on the</p>
<p>application level</p>
<p>the page level allows me to use data</p>
<p>sources that have been defined</p>
<p>data sources get defined at an</p>
<p>application level</p>
<p>now do i have to remember every single</p>
<p>time to scroll left and go to the app</p>
<p>data to create them no you don't</p>
<p>if you've forgotten</p>
<p>or you haven't got that for yet you can</p>
<p>click the plus on the data sources side</p>
<p>of things</p>
<p>it's going to ask you for a name but</p>
<p>you'll see in the connection</p>
<p>it'll give you some options in there</p>
<p>however if the one you're looking for is</p>
<p>not available</p>
<p>in the section here you can actually</p>
<p>click the plus and it'll bring up a list</p>
<p>of a lot of different connections that</p>
<p>you can actually use as well</p>
<p>so how do we actually do that</p>
<p>if i go all the way to the left</p>
<p>i'm going to go and</p>
<p>delete these two</p>
<p>let's say we go and get rid of those and</p>
<p>they're not available</p>
<p>if i want to add a new data source to</p>
<p>this page i go to the page data and i</p>
<p>click the plus</p>
<p>so what we're doing is we're trying to</p>
<p>bind a data source to be able to be used</p>
<p>on this particular page</p>
<p>on the right you'll see connections we</p>
<p>have nothing it says no data to display</p>
<p>there</p>
<p>if i click the plus it's going to give</p>
<p>me some options so i'm looking for the</p>
<p>data stream we're going to give it a</p>
<p>name</p>
<p>and everything else we can leave as</p>
<p>default and we can click save</p>
<p>now what will happen is under the drop</p>
<p>down you'll see i have a data stream</p>
<p>that is now available</p>
<p>so what we've just done there is instead</p>
<p>of me scrolling all the way to the left</p>
<p>and clicking app data to add it i'm able</p>
<p>to add it at the page layer as well</p>
<p>very handy if you</p>
<p>haven't done it or you only get to it</p>
<p>halfway through the app page when you're</p>
<p>configuring it versus having to remember</p>
<p>every single time</p>
<p>we can now give it a</p>
<p>name at the top</p>
<p>however if i go into entity</p>
<p>and i search for lunch and learn i don't</p>
<p>get anything</p>
<p>nothing's available here</p>
<p>and the reason for that is</p>
<p>the only data streams that will appear</p>
<p>here are ones that have been configured</p>
<p>to make its data available to a data</p>
<p>stream so what do i mean by that</p>
<p>under action agents if you scroll all</p>
<p>the way to the bottom</p>
<p>or you can type in the search at the top</p>
<p>and it'll filter the list view you need</p>
<p>to drag on an xmpro app</p>
<p>and add it to your data stream</p>
<p>so i'm going to unpublish my data stream</p>
<p>and we're just going to save that so the</p>
<p>first thing is you need to tell</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>data stream you're going to be making</p>
<p>your data available</p>
<p>to the app designer so that's step one</p>
<p>step two</p>
<p>make sure you give it a name that is</p>
<p>appropriate the reason for that is when</p>
<p>you come into the app designer here</p>
<p>it's going to</p>
<p>register those different endpoints and</p>
<p>you can have multiple</p>
<p>so i can have one in here as an example</p>
<p>so let me say i have a broadcast</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>i send that to the broadcast</p>
<p>and my first value</p>
<p>comes to that x and pro and then if i</p>
<p>search for x</p>
<p>again</p>
<p>now we put that here</p>
<p>i could have the next one go to the same</p>
<p>you can have multiple</p>
<p>of these on a data stream</p>
<p>why would you want multiple</p>
<p>if your data stream is doing different</p>
<p>calculations on the data you may want a</p>
<p>certain section of that to be in a</p>
<p>certain area on the app you may want the</p>
<p>results of the calculation in another</p>
<p>area of the app</p>
<p>so there are reasons why you want to</p>
<p>have</p>
<p>duplicate</p>
<p>example apps on a data stream</p>
<p>it'll become obvious when we go into a</p>
<p>lunch and learn around caching</p>
<p>and making data available to charts why</p>
<p>you would have to</p>
<p>but just remember you can have multiple</p>
<p>of these</p>
<p>on a data stream</p>
<p>the second thing is</p>
<p>if you double click that</p>
<p>you need to configure it you can't just</p>
<p>drag it on and leave it there is</p>
<p>configuration that you do need to do on</p>
<p>the xm pro app first thing is</p>
<p>where is the url this will point to the</p>
<p>app designer url</p>
<p>integration key this will point to your</p>
<p>app designer key as well</p>
<p>if you scroll down</p>
<p>you can ignore the cache settings for</p>
<p>now it's going to ask you for an</p>
<p>identifier so what is the identifier for</p>
<p>this data flowing through</p>
<p>typically it is an asset number</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>but you have flexibility to use other</p>
<p>fields as a identifier as well</p>
<p>if i go in there i can pick asset number</p>
<p>it's also going to ask you what's my</p>
<p>primary key 9 out of ten times it'll be</p>
<p>an asset number as well</p>
<p>if i go back to the second one</p>
<p>and i do the same thing there</p>
<p>we're going to configure both of those</p>
<p>and i go all the way to the bottom</p>
<p>identifier is going to be asset number</p>
<p>and primary key is going to be asset</p>
<p>number make sure you click apply at the</p>
<p>top</p>
<p>if you don't you'll notice if i go back</p>
<p>to the first one it hasn't saved my</p>
<p>changes</p>
<p>very important to remember that</p>
<p>so we go into the first two</p>
<p>we're going to scroll down</p>
<p>we're going to fill the asset number in</p>
<p>and select it</p>
<p>make sure you click apply to persist the</p>
<p>changes you made and then make sure you</p>
<p>click save or ctrl s on your keyboard to</p>
<p>save the data stream</p>
<p>now if i go back to my</p>
<p>my app that i am configuring</p>
<p>and if i try and</p>
<p>close that out and i go back to the data</p>
<p>source side</p>
<p>and we select data stream and in here</p>
<p>we're looking for for lunch and learn</p>
<p>so now if i expand that</p>
<p>it'll show me my lunch and learn coming</p>
<p>in there as well</p>
<p>for it</p>
<p>so previously</p>
<p>it was not available here you can see i</p>
<p>have availability to pretty much</p>
<p>everything that has an end point</p>
<p>for all the different data points coming</p>
<p>through</p>
<p>so if i go down to my</p>
<p>my examples they'll appear in here as</p>
<p>well</p>
<p>however</p>
<p>what we forgot to do on this side is we</p>
<p>forgot to name them appropriately</p>
<p>now because we haven't named them</p>
<p>appropriately it's going to be quite</p>
<p>hard when we get to the app side to make</p>
<p>sure we're using the correct one</p>
<p>as i mentioned you can have multiple of</p>
<p>these on a data stream so it's good</p>
<p>practice to make sure you name them</p>
<p>appropriately</p>
<p>for now we're just going to say</p>
<p>then data to app and i'm going to leave</p>
<p>the other one we'll come back to this in</p>
<p>a future lunch alone as well make sure</p>
<p>we name our broadcast so that</p>
<p>we understand what this particular data</p>
<p>stream is doing</p>
<p>if i go back into</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>configuration for</p>
<p>for this</p>
<p>you'll see there's a caching section</p>
<p>here</p>
<p>what the caching section here is saying</p>
<p>what's my initial cache size</p>
<p>so how much data do i want to keep in</p>
<p>cash</p>
<p>and then you have a few options</p>
<p>the first one says replace cash what</p>
<p>that does is</p>
<p>if my cash size is 20 and i have</p>
<p>21 items coming through my payload by</p>
<p>the time it gets here it's going to drop</p>
<p>off the first one and add a new one at</p>
<p>the back and it's going to keep doing</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>as the data is coming through the data</p>
<p>stream and being made available</p>
<p>if i tell it replace cache what that</p>
<p>does</p>
<p>is any new payload that comes all the</p>
<p>way through to this endpoint replaces</p>
<p>the prior cash payload</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>if you have a record that only comes</p>
<p>through let's say every five minutes but</p>
<p>your data is flowing every minute</p>
<p>what will happen is if you were to set</p>
<p>replace cache you could end up with a</p>
<p>situation where in that four minute</p>
<p>window you might have no data displaying</p>
<p>on your actual app side itself as well</p>
<p>so replace cache will allow you to</p>
<p>replace everything every time but just</p>
<p>be aware if your data comes in at</p>
<p>different intervals for different asset</p>
<p>types as well</p>
<p>the other one is cash for entity</p>
<p>cash per entity allows me to make use of</p>
<p>this cash</p>
<p>but per</p>
<p>the identifier that we've got at the</p>
<p>bottom</p>
<p>if i was to select that what this is now</p>
<p>saying</p>
<p>is my cash size is going to be 20</p>
<p>per asset number</p>
<p>so if i have 10 assets and each of those</p>
<p>has</p>
<p>records coming through i can catch 20</p>
<p>percent so suddenly my 20 has gone up by</p>
<p>a factor of 10. so my cash size is going</p>
<p>to be 200 in that scenario</p>
<p>the defaults</p>
<p>is everything unchecked</p>
<p>so replace cash is unchecked and cash</p>
<p>for entity is unchecked as well</p>
<p>if i run this now and i go to live view</p>
<p>i can now</p>
<p>open up the send data to to app and we</p>
<p>can keep the top one</p>
<p>so generate data is coming from my event</p>
<p>simulator</p>
<p>send data to app is what's coming</p>
<p>through my endpoint here so step one</p>
<p>before you can get data into your app</p>
<p>designer is to make sure do you have an</p>
<p>excel pro app agent on your canvas and</p>
<p>have you configured it correctly</p>
<p>now we can go into our app designer here</p>
<p>and i can actually go into my data</p>
<p>source</p>
<p>and i can say we're going to connect to</p>
<p>some live data</p>
<p>and in here you'll see i have access to</p>
<p>a lot of different</p>
<p>areas for it</p>
<p>if i go back and i have a look at</p>
<p>the launch unknown</p>
<p>just rename that differently</p>
<p>here</p>
<p>and it's in display data so let's</p>
<p>unpublish that</p>
<p>and let's republish that</p>
<p>so if i go down in here to</p>
<p>my display data</p>
<p>and i scroll all the way down</p>
<p>i'll be able to see there is my lunch</p>
<p>and learn</p>
<p>and there are my two fields</p>
<p>that have been bound</p>
<p>this is why naming is important if you</p>
<p>were to leave them both as x and pro</p>
<p>underscore zero x and per app underscore</p>
<p>one x and pro up under school two</p>
<p>you won't know</p>
<p>which of those endpoints are the ones</p>
<p>you're looking for which of them has the</p>
<p>calculations you may have done which of</p>
<p>them has the raw telemetry data and</p>
<p>which of them maybe has data with a</p>
<p>different caching option that you want</p>
<p>to use for charts as an example</p>
<p>if you haven't named them appropriately</p>
<p>you're going to struggle</p>
<p>getting to this point</p>
<p>especially if you are sharing this data</p>
<p>stream with other users</p>
<p>and they are using them to consume the</p>
<p>data but they're not necessarily fully</p>
<p>across how the data stream functions</p>
<p>where it gets its data etc</p>
<p>so the first thing we want to do</p>
<p>is we select</p>
<p>the send data to the</p>
<p>app itself</p>
<p>what you'll notice it'll do is it</p>
<p>interrogates it and gets the primary key</p>
<p>now what you'll notice is i made the</p>
<p>entire configuration</p>
<p>maximized and the reason i do that is</p>
<p>that i can see everything on the screen</p>
<p>to do that</p>
<p>you can double click the header</p>
<p>or you can click the maximize option at</p>
<p>the top there</p>
<p>this is especially useful if you have a</p>
<p>lot of data streams to go through that</p>
<p>have been bound to the example app</p>
<p>connector</p>
<p>and you want to find what you're looking</p>
<p>for</p>
<p>so it's interrogated the configuration</p>
<p>and it's automatically brought in the</p>
<p>primary key</p>
<p>as you've configured it down the bottom</p>
<p>here so if i go down here remember we</p>
<p>set the primary key was asset number</p>
<p>primary key is important over here</p>
<p>for the data when you start doing</p>
<p>advanced data</p>
<p>manipulation and advanced data work in</p>
<p>the the app designer</p>
<p>the next thing to make sure you tick</p>
<p>is when you're accessing live data</p>
<p>make sure you tick live data updates if</p>
<p>you hover over the eye it'll tell you</p>
<p>what it actually does but the live data</p>
<p>updates is what enables you to get the</p>
<p>record constantly</p>
<p>it allows you to automatically update</p>
<p>the values without refreshing the page</p>
<p>there are some</p>
<p>connectors for instance if you're</p>
<p>connecting to</p>
<p>sql</p>
<p>and the options not enabled on sql you</p>
<p>won't get this option here</p>
<p>but when you're connecting to data</p>
<p>streams there's no reason for you not to</p>
<p>take this option</p>
<p>um it's also</p>
<p>one of the first things i suggest people</p>
<p>check when they're saying well my data</p>
<p>is not flowing through to my app</p>
<p>even though i am getting data in the</p>
<p>data stream first thing to check and</p>
<p>make sure is have you enabled live</p>
<p>updates um here</p>
<p>we're going to click save</p>
<p>and as soon as we've done that what</p>
<p>you'll notice is data sources here has a</p>
<p>new option underneath it</p>
<p>it's got the name that we've defined so</p>
<p>again make sure the names you're using</p>
<p>inside your app here</p>
<p>make sense</p>
<p>and if someone else wants to use them</p>
<p>and look at them make sense to them as</p>
<p>well</p>
<p>we bring in all the data fields</p>
<p>they're also bound to what their data</p>
<p>type is so you can see</p>
<p>their decimal strings date times etc</p>
<p>there is an area for you to calculate</p>
<p>and create expressions we'll cover that</p>
<p>in another lunch and learn as well</p>
<p>so if you're not sure what fields i'll</p>
<p>be made available what can i actually</p>
<p>view and read</p>
<p>just go to the page data</p>
<p>expand the data sources and you have</p>
<p>access to the information here</p>
<p>now what we can do is we can actually</p>
<p>bind this information to the</p>
<p>element we're looking for</p>
<p>again if you're looking for a data</p>
<p>source that's not here so let's say we</p>
<p>don't want to bind this to live data you</p>
<p>can click the plus</p>
<p>brings you to exactly the same place</p>
<p>so you do not have to go back to the</p>
<p>page data and click the plus here every</p>
<p>time to add a new data source you can do</p>
<p>it from within the area that you're busy</p>
<p>with</p>
<p>pull the information in</p>
<p>once you've done that it'll refresh the</p>
<p>drop down for you here</p>
<p>close that out and we can now select the</p>
<p>data source as soon as we've done that</p>
<p>you'll see we get a yellow border that</p>
<p>comes around</p>
<p>and if i go into the text</p>
<p>and i go to the appearance i can now</p>
<p>click the a</p>
<p>which is static</p>
<p>it then turns into a dynamic and now i</p>
<p>get a drop down this drop down is now</p>
<p>bound to that same data source so now i</p>
<p>can actually bind it to the asset number</p>
<p>field coming in</p>
<p>if i was to save that and i run the</p>
<p>you'll see the asset number now is being</p>
<p>passed through from the actual app</p>
<p>now what i can start doing is if i go</p>
<p>back and edit the the app</p>
<p>i can actually go through this</p>
<p>particular box and i can duplicate that</p>
<p>and this one here we can say is reading</p>
<p>number</p>
<p>and i can go into that field</p>
<p>go to its appearance</p>
<p>and change it to reading number as an</p>
<p>example</p>
<p>we can now save that</p>
<p>now what you'll notice</p>
<p>is the number keeps going up so the live</p>
<p>data</p>
<p>the checkbox that we selected is what is</p>
<p>enabling this to constantly change its</p>
<p>value without me having to refresh the</p>
<p>screen</p>
<p>there are areas where you get i would</p>
<p>say static type information coming</p>
<p>through</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>without taking that you would have to</p>
<p>refresh the screen every time to get</p>
<p>that information to come through</p>
<p>the second area where you can actually</p>
<p>configure it in a</p>
<p>an app</p>
<p>is if i go to the app data side</p>
<p>they are</p>
<p>specific</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>sql</p>
<p>there are specific connectors that will</p>
<p>allow you to connect directly to data</p>
<p>sources as well</p>
<p>each of those is available</p>
<p>for you to connect as you need to</p>
<p>the primary one that gets used is the</p>
<p>data stream connector here</p>
<p>but there are other connectors that do</p>
<p>not require a data stream and you can</p>
<p>connect directly to the systems</p>
<p>the the only</p>
<p>functionality that you might lose by</p>
<p>doing that is the live view option</p>
<p>so again if i click the pencil next to</p>
<p>my existing</p>
<p>data stream here</p>
<p>this option might not be supported if</p>
<p>you connect directly to the systems of</p>
<p>choice</p>
<p>it's not all of them supported which</p>
<p>means if you are connecting to those</p>
<p>systems and you do want that data to</p>
<p>refresh</p>
<p>the the screen will need to be manually</p>
<p>refreshed to do that</p>
<p>as well</p>
<p>so just to recap</p>
<p>if we come back to</p>
<p>the data stream so where's the first</p>
<p>area that i go to to connect data to</p>
<p>my app</p>
<p>inside a data stream</p>
<p>what you want to do is under x and pro</p>
<p>agents right at the bottom you'll see</p>
<p>the axon pro app</p>
<p>that is the key that allows you to</p>
<p>connect it</p>
<p>to a app and make it available</p>
<p>make sure you name them appropriately</p>
<p>otherwise when you're configuring it on</p>
<p>the other side you might have some</p>
<p>problems trying to remember which one is</p>
<p>for which one</p>
<p>we'll go into a lot more detail on</p>
<p>caching options in a future lunch and</p>
<p>learn as well for now</p>
<p>you can use the the defaults</p>
<p>to return the data coming in</p>
<p>step one is done in the data stream step</p>
<p>two you do in the app designer side</p>
<p>again you can scroll all the way and at</p>
<p>an app data level add a new connector</p>
<p>or you can do it at the page level</p>
<p>so page level is where you're creating</p>
<p>an instance connecting to a specific</p>
<p>data stream connecting to a specific</p>
<p>table</p>
<p>um or whatever system it is that you're</p>
<p>connecting to</p>
<p>the plus will walk you through the steps</p>
<p>so if there's something in the</p>
<p>connection that you know is available</p>
<p>but you can't see it here click the plus</p>
<p>there again and it'll walk you through</p>
<p>that as well</p>
<p>once you've selected your items make</p>
<p>sure you remember the live data update</p>
<p>section</p>
<p>otherwise what's going to happen is your</p>
<p>information is going to stay static on</p>
<p>the screen</p>
<p>and you're not going to get the</p>
<p>information constantly refreshing itself</p>
<p>coming through as well</p>
<p>you all for attending today um</p>
<p>how do i bind data to to my app</p>
<p>most of it gets done through a</p>
<p>data stream using the app agent</p>
<p>there are ways to do it directly through</p>
<p>data sources in the app designer you</p>
<p>however will lose some functionality</p>
<p>there as well but it is very possible to</p>
<p>do that as well</p>
<p>thank you again for attending today's</p>
<p>lunch and learn hope to see on some</p>
<p>future ones</p>
