<p>In this video we cover our introduction and case study, looking at what happens when a Composable Digital Twin strategy is effectively implemented - in this example we look at one of our mining customers that have successfully built multiple digital twin solutions for their underground mining conveyor belts, crushers, pumps and more.</p>
<details>
<summary>Transcript</summary>welcome to this overview presentation on
<p>xmpro's event intelligence tools that</p>
<p>help you manage complex operations in</p>
<p>real time at scale XM Pro enables you to</p>
<p>create a common operating picture that</p>
<p>informs you of what business events are</p>
<p>happening or likely to happen and put</p>
<p>you in control of how you respond to</p>
<p>these events that impact your operations</p>
<p>I'd like to start with an example of an</p>
<p>XM Pro customer who got this right</p>
<p>This Global Mining Company reduced</p>
<p>underground conveyor downtime for a</p>
<p>specific failure mode by more than 70</p>
<p>percent and as a result I gained 184</p>
<p>hours of additional production equating</p>
<p>to about 44 000 product tons for this</p>
<p>particular mine all this happened one</p>
<p>mile underground and XM Pro provides a</p>
<p>common operating picture for 52</p>
<p>conveyors covering more than 50 miles or</p>
<p>80 kilometers of underground tunnels</p>
<p>this common operating picture is a</p>
<p>simple London Tube map star</p>
<p>representation of the underground</p>
<p>conveyor system at the start of the</p>
<p>project the XM Pro recommendation engine</p>
<p>identified many high and medium severity</p>
<p>events that needed to be responded to</p>
<p>before the motor protection would trip</p>
<p>and stop the the conveyor system</p>
<p>five months later the picture changed</p>
<p>drastically there were only a handful of</p>
<p>medium severity events and the</p>
<p>maintenance planners had more than</p>
<p>enough time to address these in advance</p>
<p>the overall time to resolve new events</p>
<p>decreased drastically from 556 hours to</p>
<p>276 hours as reliability Engineers now</p>
<p>spent more time during the initial</p>
<p>investigation phase which has gone up</p>
<p>from 1 hour 46 minutes to 12 hours 42</p>
<p>minutes these Engineers now have the</p>
<p>right data to address the real causes of</p>
<p>downtime at the right time</p>
<p>not only did they manage to address</p>
<p>downtime of the conveyors for specific</p>
<p>root causes but they extended this</p>
<p>common operating picture to underground</p>
<p>borers and in the following six months</p>
<p>they added pumps crushes fans and some</p>
<p>money some management oee kpis to the</p>
<p>operating picture</p>
<p>with the XM Pro digital twin composition</p>
<p>platform that could add capabilities</p>
<p>incrementally as they built out new</p>
<p>event intelligence</p>
<p>that the common operating picture</p>
<p>provides this includes adding computer</p>
<p>vision to detect splice failure on the</p>
<p>conveyors for example</p>
<p>by also combining the conveyors with the</p>
<p>Boris and the Hoist they created an</p>
<p>underground digital twin that provides a</p>
<p>real-time common operating picture of</p>
<p>the crucial and critical subsurface</p>
<p>operations with prescriptive</p>
<p>recommendations that provide a</p>
<p>consistent response to events that are</p>
<p>happening or are likely to happen</p>
<p>the leadership of the company saw the</p>
<p>fact that their own Engineers were able</p>
<p>to compose this operational view</p>
<p>themselves as the real digital</p>
<p>transformation that they were seeking it</p>
<p>provides them with a competitive</p>
<p>advantage that drastically improves</p>
<p>operations</p>
<p>it further enables them to add</p>
<p>additional capabilities to existing use</p>
<p>cases in an incremental way to create</p>
<p>composite or system digital twins</p>
<p>combining the conveyor in the borers as</p>
<p>a basic underground digital twin</p>
<p>provides a common operating picture of</p>
<p>the combined assets that form a key part</p>
<p>of the underground operations</p>
<p>the example common operating picture</p>
<p>delivers greater than 10x return on</p>
<p>investment in the first year and the</p>
<p>time to value for the first use case was</p>
<p>less than 30 days it also enabled the</p>
<p>business to capture expert knowledge as</p>
<p>part of the process and currently it's</p>
<p>processing about 42 million messages a</p>
<p>day which equates to about 340 million</p>
<p>data points so significant scaling from</p>
<p>that perspective</p>
