<p>In this section, we discuss why having a Common Operating Picture is critical to a successful Digital Twin strategy for managing complex operations. We also discuss the difference between reactive and prescriptive operations, and why real-time event intelligence matters.</p>
<details>
<summary>Transcript</summary>so what problem is XM Pro solving for us
<p>real-time operations is real every day</p>
<p>your business is exposed to more and</p>
<p>more internal and external events that</p>
<p>need to be responded to</p>
<p>in real time and these events can come</p>
<p>from</p>
<p>the actions of people in your business</p>
<p>the actions of your competitors</p>
<p>customers legislators suppliers</p>
<p>equipment that break down process</p>
<p>failures severe weather events the</p>
<p>operational intelligence that you gather</p>
<p>from all the other business systems that</p>
<p>you have all the other data sources and</p>
<p>web services</p>
<p>and currently we've seen the influx of</p>
<p>information from internet of things with</p>
<p>sensor-based or smart device or</p>
<p>machine-borne data as part of this</p>
<p>Village of information that come at you</p>
<p>now how you respond to these events is</p>
<p>really the key</p>
<p>and the value of real-time information</p>
<p>that you receive on when things are</p>
<p>happening or likely to happen and</p>
<p>depreciate over time so when you know a</p>
<p>certain condition exists you have</p>
<p>limited time and depending on what it is</p>
<p>what the event is that time span that</p>
<p>you have to to respond to it very so you</p>
<p>want to be notified when these things</p>
<p>happen</p>
<p>now for us event intelligence is that</p>
<p>ability to still impact the outcome of</p>
<p>the event so typically as you see here</p>
<p>the sand still flowing before it lands</p>
<p>and it settles then it becomes business</p>
<p>intelligence then I can do reporting on</p>
<p>what were my failures what were the</p>
<p>losses what we're trying to do with</p>
<p>event intelligence and the problem that</p>
<p>X and pro is solving is how do we how do</p>
<p>we impact the outcome of an event by</p>
<p>having the ability to intervene now this</p>
<p>sounds</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>very straightforward but why is this odd</p>
<p>it requires subject matter experts to</p>
<p>understand have the knowledge and</p>
<p>context of the problem that needs to be</p>
<p>solved in real time then you need to be</p>
<p>able to</p>
<p>do the data engineering bring that</p>
<p>real-time data in do the orchestration</p>
<p>before you can create an application of</p>
<p>that in terms of a digital twin or a</p>
<p>application that can that can inform you</p>
<p>of the event that's happening and most</p>
<p>organizations have a challenge just</p>
<p>putting these three foundational things</p>
<p>together when we talk to operations</p>
<p>managers what we hear they say is they</p>
<p>just don't want to be blindsided by</p>
<p>business events or operational events</p>
<p>and this is not just in a certain area</p>
<p>but it's actually it spans across all</p>
<p>the areas in terms of the actual</p>
<p>production manufacturing processes the</p>
<p>asset health and performance</p>
<p>the environmental safety risk people in</p>
<p>HR processes and more and more Supply</p>
<p>chains all these events and the</p>
<p>combination of events causes a real</p>
<p>headache now this is where a common</p>
<p>operating picture provides information</p>
<p>at all levels of the organization to be</p>
<p>able to address that what we also hear</p>
<p>is that they want to reduce their</p>
<p>Reliance on third parties to create this</p>
<p>competitive Advantage because their</p>
<p>subject matter experts in the business</p>
<p>have a deep understanding of how it</p>
<p>works and most of the technologists</p>
<p>reliability Engineers automation</p>
<p>engineers</p>
<p>geophysicists people like that the the</p>
<p>technical business technologists</p>
<p>have more and more technical skills they</p>
<p>are technologists</p>
<p>so what you want to do with them is</p>
<p>given the ability to take some templates</p>
<p>and blueprints and expand on those to</p>
<p>create this so for that you want you</p>
<p>really want the no code application</p>
<p>composition kind of approach for those</p>
<p>subject matter experts they don't have</p>
<p>to code but they understand exactly what</p>
<p>they want to create and do that in a</p>
<p>composable fashion the last thing we</p>
<p>hear they say is that they want to</p>
<p>digitize and automate event response so</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>the real objective is to be able to</p>
<p>bring all of the data from all these</p>
<p>different systems that you already have</p>
<p>in the business without ripping and</p>
<p>replacing them and automating that so</p>
<p>that there's Real Time Event detection</p>
<p>and response and this needs to be scaled</p>
<p>out in a large complex organization so</p>
<p>for that again you would want no code</p>
<p>integration with the orchestration and</p>
<p>automation capabilities now this is</p>
<p>where composable digital twins enable</p>
<p>you to actually create that event-based</p>
<p>common operating picture at scale</p>
<p>the notion of a common operating picture</p>
<p>actually comes from emergency and</p>
<p>natural disaster response as well as</p>
<p>from the military we're at a strategic</p>
<p>tactical and operational level everyone</p>
<p>looks at the same data but from a</p>
<p>different perspective so it's all the</p>
<p>same data at the same at the different</p>
<p>levels but different perspectives on how</p>
<p>this is used</p>
<p>and the common operating picture from at</p>
<p>the Strategic level may have a higher</p>
<p>level in just in terms of kpis and</p>
<p>monitoring across a broad range at a</p>
<p>tactical level it's more of a planning</p>
<p>a lens that is applied in operational</p>
<p>level it is what is happening on a in a</p>
<p>very specific area around a specific</p>
<p>asset or production process</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and you want that common operating</p>
<p>picture to be agile so that you can</p>
<p>change it as your business strategy or</p>
<p>some of the business conditions change</p>
<p>you need to be able to do that quite</p>
<p>simply and you want to you also want it</p>
<p>to be composable and maintained by your</p>
<p>own smes and bring in the data from all</p>
<p>the systems that you already have to</p>
<p>give you automated prescriptive</p>
<p>recommendations making sure that</p>
<p>different people have the same</p>
<p>actions on the same data set so great</p>
<p>consistency across the organization and</p>
<p>being able to capture the knowledge from</p>
<p>experts in your business and in future</p>
<p>support that with AI and machine</p>
<p>learning and this will enable you to</p>
<p>close the loop on actions it will</p>
<p>provide a very consistent way of dealing</p>
<p>with certain events happening in a by</p>
<p>providing prescriptive recommendations</p>
<p>and a key aspect is that you can</p>
<p>actually use this to create a</p>
<p>self-validating digital twin that</p>
<p>continuously Monitor and validate as it</p>
<p>sits now how this common operating</p>
<p>picture fits into you in most typical</p>
<p>organizations you already have assets</p>
<p>that have sensors scada plc's all of</p>
<p>that there's hundreds of different</p>
<p>systems in your business already</p>
<p>historians erps all sorts of operational</p>
<p>databases and we're seeing emergence of</p>
<p>AI and machine learning tools and a</p>
<p>whole bunch of other third-party</p>
<p>applications and what you're trying to</p>
<p>do is manage that through people</p>
<p>processes and Technology automation that</p>
<p>you may already have so how you respond</p>
<p>to that when things happen now</p>
<p>the first part as we mentioned in the</p>
<p>event intelligence part is being able to</p>
<p>take the data in from all of these</p>
<p>different systems how do we take the</p>
<p>signals the data all of that into</p>
<p>and take the millions of data points and</p>
<p>reduce it to the the key events that we</p>
<p>are looking for whether production</p>
<p>events asset</p>
<p>health events or ESG and other risk</p>
<p>based events as well so how can we take</p>
<p>all those signals provide context to it</p>
<p>and then use that and give few events</p>
<p>that we've that we've identified that</p>
<p>event intelligence create that common</p>
<p>operating picture at the Strategic</p>
<p>tactical and operational levels all the</p>
<p>same data nothing upwardly filtered to</p>
<p>make it look better when it gets to the</p>
<p>highest level everyone looks at the same</p>
<p>data by different lenses and this</p>
<p>provides the real operations</p>
<p>intelligence or the common operating</p>
<p>picture that enables people processes</p>
<p>and automation to actually deal with</p>
<p>that event response and the disruption</p>
<p>management that is associated with that</p>
<p>the other big benefit of using a a tool</p>
<p>like X and pro to create a common</p>
<p>operating picture is you can bring</p>
<p>prescriptive or you can create</p>
<p>prescriptive recommendations for at all</p>
<p>levels in a very consistent way you can</p>
<p>also bring in alarms and alerts from</p>
<p>other systems into this common operating</p>
<p>view again to make sure that</p>
<p>recommendations are consistent across</p>
<p>the business</p>
<p>so XM Pro in itself well the the this</p>
<p>enables you to empower your your</p>
<p>smartest people to pull the the value</p>
<p>levers that align with your your</p>
<p>business at all levels it reduced the</p>
<p>risk of being blindsided by key business</p>
<p>events that are happening or likely to</p>
<p>happen and it improves accountability</p>
<p>and close the feedback loop that</p>
<p>provides availability visibility and the</p>
<p>opportunity for learning</p>
