<p>Composable Digital Twins Enable You To Create An Event-based Common Operating Picture At Scale</p>
<details>
<summary>Transcript</summary>welcome to this overview presentation on
<p>xmpro's event intelligence tools that</p>
<p>help you manage complex operations in</p>
<p>real time at scale XM Pro enables you to</p>
<p>create a common operating picture that</p>
<p>informs you of what business events are</p>
<p>happening or likely to happen and put</p>
<p>you in control of how you respond to</p>
<p>these events that impact your operations</p>
<p>I'd like to start with an example of an</p>
<p>XM Pro customer who got this right</p>
<p>This Global Mining Company reduced</p>
<p>underground conveyor downtime for a</p>
<p>specific failure mode by more than 70</p>
<p>percent and as a result I gained 184</p>
<p>hours of additional production equating</p>
<p>to about 44 000 product tons for this</p>
<p>particular mine all this happened one</p>
<p>mile underground and XM Pro provides a</p>
<p>common operating picture for 52</p>
<p>conveyors covering more than 50 miles or</p>
<p>80 kilometers of underground tunnels</p>
<p>this common operating picture is a</p>
<p>simple London Tube map star</p>
<p>representation of the underground</p>
<p>conveyor system at the start of the</p>
<p>project the XM Pro recommendation engine</p>
<p>identified many high and medium severity</p>
<p>events that needed to be responded to</p>
<p>before the motor protection would trip</p>
<p>and stop the the conveyor system</p>
<p>five months later the picture changed</p>
<p>drastically there were only a handful of</p>
<p>medium severity events and the</p>
<p>maintenance planners had more than</p>
<p>enough time to address these in advance</p>
<p>the overall time to resolve new events</p>
<p>decreased drastically from 556 hours to</p>
<p>276 hours as reliability Engineers now</p>
<p>spent more time during the initial</p>
<p>investigation phase which has gone up</p>
<p>from 1 hour 46 minutes to 12 hours 42</p>
<p>minutes these Engineers now have the</p>
<p>right data to address the real causes of</p>
<p>downtime at the right time</p>
<p>not only did they manage to address</p>
<p>downtime of the conveyors for specific</p>
<p>root causes but they extended this</p>
<p>common operating picture to underground</p>
<p>borers and in the following six months</p>
<p>they added pumps crushes fans and some</p>
<p>money some management oee kpis to the</p>
<p>operating picture</p>
<p>with the XM Pro digital twin composition</p>
<p>platform that could add capabilities</p>
<p>incrementally as they built out new</p>
<p>event intelligence</p>
<p>that the common operating picture</p>
<p>provides this includes adding computer</p>
<p>vision to detect splice failure on the</p>
<p>conveyors for example</p>
<p>by also combining the conveyors with the</p>
<p>Boris and the Hoist they created an</p>
<p>underground digital twin that provides a</p>
<p>real-time common operating picture of</p>
<p>the crucial and critical subsurface</p>
<p>operations with prescriptive</p>
<p>recommendations that provide a</p>
<p>consistent response to events that are</p>
<p>happening or are likely to happen</p>
<p>the leadership of the company saw the</p>
<p>fact that their own Engineers were able</p>
<p>to compose this operational view</p>
<p>themselves as the real digital</p>
<p>transformation that they were seeking it</p>
<p>provides them with a competitive</p>
<p>advantage that drastically improves</p>
<p>operations</p>
<p>it further enables them to add</p>
<p>additional capabilities to existing use</p>
<p>cases in an incremental way to create</p>
<p>composite or system digital twins</p>
<p>combining the conveyor in the borers as</p>
<p>a basic underground digital twin</p>
<p>provides a common operating picture of</p>
<p>the combined assets that form a key part</p>
<p>of the underground operations</p>
<p>the example common operating picture</p>
<p>delivers greater than 10x return on</p>
<p>investment in the first year and the</p>
<p>time to value for the first use case was</p>
<p>less than 30 days it also enabled the</p>
<p>business to capture expert knowledge as</p>
<p>part of the process and currently it's</p>
<p>processing about 42 million messages a</p>
<p>day which equates to about 340 million</p>
<p>data points so significant scaling from</p>
<p>that perspective</p>
<p>so what problem is XM Pro solving for us</p>
<p>real-time operations is real every day</p>
<p>your business is exposed to more and</p>
<p>more internal and external events that</p>
<p>need to be responded to</p>
<p>in real time and these events can come</p>
<p>from</p>
<p>the actions of people in your business</p>
<p>the actions of your competitors</p>
<p>customers legislators suppliers</p>
<p>equipment that break down process</p>
<p>failures severe weather events the</p>
<p>operational intelligence that you gather</p>
<p>from all the other business systems that</p>
<p>you have all the other data sources and</p>
<p>web services</p>
<p>and currently we've seen the influx of</p>
<p>information from internet of things with</p>
<p>sensor based or smart device or</p>
<p>machine-borne data as part of this</p>
<p>Village of information that come at you</p>
<p>now how you respond to these events is</p>
<p>really the key</p>
<p>and the value of real-time information</p>
<p>that you receive on when things are</p>
<p>happening or likely to happen and</p>
<p>depreciate over time so when you know a</p>
<p>certain condition exists you have</p>
<p>limited time and depending on what it is</p>
<p>what the event is that time span that</p>
<p>you have to to respond to it very so you</p>
<p>want to be notified when these things</p>
<p>happen</p>
<p>now for us event intelligence is that</p>
<p>ability to still impact the outcome of</p>
<p>the event so it's typically as you see</p>
<p>here the sand is still flowing before it</p>
<p>lands and it settles then it becomes</p>
<p>business intelligence then I can do</p>
<p>reporting on what were my failures what</p>
<p>were the losses what we're trying to do</p>
<p>with the event intelligence and the</p>
<p>problem that X and pro is solving is how</p>
<p>do we how do we impact the outcome of an</p>
<p>event by having the ability to intervene</p>
<p>now this sounds</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>very straightforward but why is this odd</p>
<p>it requires subject matter experts to</p>
<p>understand have the knowledge and</p>
<p>context of the problem that needs to be</p>
<p>solved in real time then you need to be</p>
<p>able to</p>
<p>do the data engineering bring that</p>
<p>real-time data in do the orchestration</p>
<p>before you can create an application of</p>
<p>that in terms of a digital twin or a</p>
<p>application that can that can inform you</p>
<p>of the event that's happening and most</p>
<p>organizations have a challenge just</p>
<p>putting these three foundational things</p>
<p>together when we talk to operations</p>
<p>managers what we hear they say is they</p>
<p>just don't want to be blindsided by</p>
<p>business events or operational events</p>
<p>and this is not just in a certain area</p>
<p>but it's actually it spans across all</p>
<p>the areas in terms of the actual</p>
<p>production manufacturing processes the</p>
<p>asset health and performance</p>
<p>the environmental safety risk people in</p>
<p>HR processes and more and more Supply</p>
<p>chains all these events and the</p>
<p>combination of events causes a real</p>
<p>headache now this is where a common</p>
<p>operating picture provides information</p>
<p>at all levels of the organization to be</p>
<p>able to address that what we also hear</p>
<p>is that they want to reduce the Reliance</p>
<p>on third parties to create this</p>
<p>competitive Advantage because their</p>
<p>subject matter experts in the business</p>
<p>have a deep understanding of how it</p>
<p>works and most of the technologists</p>
<p>reliability Engineers automation</p>
<p>engineers</p>
<p>geophysicists people like that the the</p>
<p>technical business technologists have</p>
<p>more and more technical skills they are</p>
<p>technologists</p>
<p>so what you want to do with them is</p>
<p>given the ability to take some templates</p>
<p>and blueprints and expand on those to</p>
<p>create this so for that you want you</p>
<p>really want a no code application</p>
<p>composition kind of approach for those</p>
<p>subject matter experts they don't have</p>
<p>to code but they understand exactly what</p>
<p>they want to create and do that in a</p>
<p>composable fashion</p>
<p>the last thing we hear they say is that</p>
<p>they want to digitize and automate event</p>
<p>response so the</p>
<p>real objective is to be able to bring</p>
<p>all of the data from all these different</p>
<p>systems that you already have in the</p>
<p>business without ripping and replacing</p>
<p>them and automating that so that there's</p>
<p>Real Time Event detection and response</p>
<p>and this needs to be scaled out in a</p>
<p>large complex organization so for that</p>
<p>again you would want no code integration</p>
<p>with the orchestration and automation</p>
<p>capabilities now this is where</p>
<p>composable digital twins enable you to</p>
<p>actually create that event-based common</p>
<p>operating picture at scale</p>
<p>the notion of a common upriving picture</p>
<p>actually comes from emergency and</p>
<p>natural disaster response as well as</p>
<p>from the military we're at a strategic</p>
<p>tactical and operational level everyone</p>
<p>looks at the same data but from a</p>
<p>different perspective so it's all the</p>
<p>same data at the same at the different</p>
<p>levels but different perspectives on how</p>
<p>this is used</p>
<p>and the common operating picture from at</p>
<p>the Strategic level may have a higher</p>
<p>level in just in terms of kpis and</p>
<p>monitoring across a broad range at a</p>
<p>tactical level it's more of a planning</p>
<p>a lens that is applied in operational</p>
<p>level it is what is happening on a in a</p>
<p>very specific area around a specific</p>
<p>asset or production process</p>
<p>and you want that common operating</p>
<p>picture to be agile so that you can</p>
<p>change it as your business strategy or</p>
<p>some of the business conditions change</p>
<p>you need to be able to do that quite</p>
<p>simply and you want to you also want it</p>
<p>to be composable and maintained by your</p>
<p>own smes and bringing the data from all</p>
<p>the systems that you already have to</p>
<p>give you automated prescriptive</p>
<p>recommendations making sure that</p>
<p>different people have the same</p>
<p>actions on the same data set so to</p>
<p>create consistency across the</p>
<p>organization and being able to capture</p>
<p>the knowledge from experts in your</p>
<p>business and your future support that</p>
<p>with AI and machine learning and this</p>
<p>will enable you to close the loop on</p>
<p>actions it will provide a very</p>
<p>consistent way of dealing with certain</p>
<p>events happening in a by providing</p>
<p>prescriptive recommendations and a key</p>
<p>aspect is that you can actually use this</p>
<p>to create a self-validating digital twin</p>
<p>that continuously Monitor and validate</p>
<p>as it sits now how this common operating</p>
<p>picture fits into you in most typical</p>
<p>organizations you already have assets</p>
<p>that have sensors scada plc's all of</p>
<p>that there's hundreds of different</p>
<p>systems in your business already</p>
<p>historians erps all sorts of operational</p>
<p>databases and we're seeing emergence of</p>
<p>AI and machine learning tools and a</p>
<p>whole bunch of other third-party</p>
<p>applications and what you're trying to</p>
<p>do is manage that through people</p>
<p>processes and Technology automation that</p>
<p>you may already have so how you respond</p>
<p>to that when things happen now</p>
<p>the first part as we mentioned in the</p>
<p>event intelligence part is being able to</p>
<p>take the data in from all of these</p>
<p>different systems how do we take the</p>
<p>signals the data all of that into</p>
<p>and take the millions of data points and</p>
<p>reduce it to the the key events that we</p>
<p>are looking for whether production</p>
<p>events asset</p>
<p>health events or ESG and other risk</p>
<p>based events as well so how can we take</p>
<p>all those signals provide context to it</p>
<p>and then use that and the key few events</p>
<p>that we've that we've identified that</p>
<p>event intelligence create that common</p>
<p>operating picture at the Strategic</p>
<p>tactical and operational levels all the</p>
<p>same data nothing upwardly filtered to</p>
<p>make it look better when it gets to the</p>
<p>highest level everyone looks at the same</p>
<p>data but different lenses and this</p>
<p>provides the real operations</p>
<p>intelligence or the common operating</p>
<p>picture that enables people processes</p>
<p>and automation to actually deal with</p>
<p>that event response and the disruption</p>
<p>management that is associated with that</p>
<p>the other big benefit of using a a tool</p>
<p>like X and pro to create a common</p>
<p>operating picture is you can bring</p>
<p>prescriptive or you can create</p>
<p>prescriptive recommendations for at all</p>
<p>levels in a very consistent way you can</p>
<p>also bring in alarms and alerts from</p>
<p>other systems into this common operating</p>
<p>view again to make sure that</p>
<p>recommendations are consistent across</p>
<p>the business</p>
<p>so XM Pro in itself well the the this</p>
<p>enables you to empower your your</p>
<p>smartest people to pull the the value</p>
<p>levers that align with your your</p>
<p>business at all levels it reduced the</p>
<p>risk of being blindsided by key business</p>
<p>events that are happening or likely to</p>
<p>happen and it improves accountability</p>
<p>and close the feedback loop that</p>
<p>provides availability visibility and the</p>
<p>opportunity for learning</p>
<p>example itself is a digital twin</p>
<p>composition platform that accelerates</p>
<p>operational and situational awareness</p>
<p>and we do this in a now code fashion</p>
<p>for those industrial business</p>
<p>technologists to be able to create a</p>
<p>common operating picture composable</p>
<p>digital twins that are more complex and</p>
<p>then real-time event intelligence</p>
<p>applications</p>
<p>and we do this</p>
<p>as a business capability to to help with</p>
<p>safer green and more responsible</p>
<p>industrial operations and doing it</p>
<p>faster so that there's a there are</p>
<p>higher efficiencies and economic return</p>
<p>for everyone in the ecosystem talking</p>
<p>about the ecosystem</p>
<p>in the specifically in large complex</p>
<p>environments there is a ecosystem of</p>
<p>existing applications and the role that</p>
<p>XM Pro fulfills in this is is</p>
<p>orchestrating and providing the</p>
<p>composition from all of these different</p>
<p>systems to create that composable</p>
<p>digital twin that that will give you a</p>
<p>common operating picture so</p>
<p>bringing in or not it's not replacing</p>
<p>and ripping and replacing all any of the</p>
<p>systems that you have but it's more</p>
<p>around how do we integrate and and</p>
<p>orchestrate the information and</p>
<p>capabilities from the different systems</p>
<p>now this application composition</p>
<p>approach is not a new thing and it's</p>
<p>for example this is positioned or this</p>
<p>is from Gartner on creating scalable</p>
<p>um composable applications for the type</p>
<p>of industries that or the type of</p>
<p>applications that we see in large-scale</p>
<p>industry and this consists of an</p>
<p>integrated data fabric at the bottom</p>
<p>coming from multiple data sources but</p>
<p>there's this notion of a composition</p>
<p>platform that handles integration</p>
<p>orchestration ux development and you</p>
<p>have packaged business capabilities that</p>
<p>sit within</p>
<p>this that you can reuse so leak</p>
<p>detection or credit fraud or things like</p>
<p>that these are all package capabilities</p>
<p>that you can reuse and some of them</p>
<p>might be application based some of it</p>
<p>might be process based some of them</p>
<p>might be might be data type package</p>
<p>business capabilities but that enables</p>
<p>you to grade</p>
<p>what is what they refer to as composed</p>
<p>application experiences what we've done</p>
<p>at XM Pro we've taken this approach and</p>
<p>turn that into composable digital twins</p>
<p>so xampro is a composable digital twin</p>
<p>platform and help enables you to do</p>
<p>integration composition orchestration</p>
<p>the development side and also the ux for</p>
<p>a whole bunch of capabilities and in our</p>
<p>Industries</p>
<p>the typical data types or physics-based</p>
<p>models analytics iot transactional</p>
<p>systems visual data and master data that</p>
<p>is all combined to be able to create</p>
<p>these type of composed digital twins</p>
<p>that provide a common operating picture</p>
<p>for example on on that long conveyor</p>
<p>predictive maintenance or first pass</p>
<p>yield optimization or intelligent</p>
<p>building energy optimization and we do</p>
<p>that with our data stream designer and</p>
<p>with our application designers the two</p>
<p>main components to be able to compose</p>
<p>these digital twins in a no code way</p>
<p>that are also explainable</p>
<p>and can be deployed at scale the</p>
<p>approach around uh</p>
<p>reusing capabilities is very similar to</p>
<p>what you see with the building bricks</p>
<p>that kids might play with in this</p>
<p>example I can break this apart and for</p>
<p>example build I off-road 4x4 vehicle</p>
<p>reusing many of the parts I might have</p>
<p>to add one or two others and I might be</p>
<p>left with a few ones afterwards but this</p>
<p>ability of composing and reusing Parts</p>
<p>is really how the composable digital</p>
<p>twin enable you to create a common</p>
<p>operating picture at scale</p>
<p>the way that we do that at XM Pro is</p>
<p>really in three steps the first one is</p>
<p>to create those data streams in a visual</p>
<p>drag and drop way and integrate to a</p>
<p>larger library of integration</p>
<p>endpoints that we have and then the next</p>
<p>part is to provide the visualization of</p>
<p>that in real time for the operations</p>
<p>this is where the common operating</p>
<p>picture gets visualized but the probably</p>
<p>one of the more important parts is how</p>
<p>do we make sure that we can action what</p>
<p>comes out of that in a consistent Manner</p>
<p>and that's where the XM prior</p>
<p>recommendation engine comes in</p>
<p>this is a quick overview of exam Pro and</p>
<p>how we deliver a common operating</p>
<p>picture using a composable digital twin</p>
<p>framework to enable you to run your</p>
<p>business in real time making better</p>
<p>decisions faster</p>
