<summary>Transcript</summary>hi all and welcome to another lunch and
<p>learn</p>
<p>today what we're going to be covering is</p>
<p>variables and expression</p>
<p>with a focus in the the app designer</p>
<p>itself</p>
<p>so what is it so variables are</p>
<p>essentially placeholders</p>
<p>they are</p>
<p>are they used to to maintain static</p>
<p>values but you can update them</p>
<p>through the course of interacting with</p>
<p>the actual app itself</p>
<p>you can use variables in the expression</p>
<p>editor</p>
<p>you can use other variables with them</p>
<p>calculated fields etc</p>
<p>and an expression</p>
<p>you can think of that as an extra column</p>
<p>on a data source</p>
<p>it allows you to to calculate a</p>
<p>different additional fields different</p>
<p>values</p>
<p>that you can actually use when binding</p>
<p>that data source</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>to the actual form itself</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>we're going to cover two main areas of</p>
<p>variable use in the app designer</p>
<p>there are three</p>
<p>we're just going to focus on the two</p>
<p>that are within the app design and the</p>
<p>third one is actually in the data stream</p>
<p>designer uh we'll cover that in a</p>
<p>another luncheon when we tackle some of</p>
<p>the items in the data stream designer so</p>
<p>for today we're just going to focus on</p>
<p>the two areas of variable use</p>
<p>in the app designer itself</p>
<p>we're going to tackle variables within</p>
<p>an app so where are they how do we get</p>
<p>to them how do we view them</p>
<p>etc</p>
<p>and some basic requirements you always</p>
<p>need access to the app designer</p>
<p>to tackle the one the second area it is</p>
<p>an administrative area</p>
<p>um typically it's something you'll set</p>
<p>up and configure once so you might not</p>
<p>have it depending on your access into</p>
<p>the actual site itself</p>
<p>uh skill level for this um there are</p>
<p>some beginner pieces in here but we're</p>
<p>starting to move into more of the</p>
<p>intermediate skill levels um as we start</p>
<p>configuring these as well</p>
<p>there are two external links as well</p>
<p>i've got them on the right and i'll walk</p>
<p>through what those are as we get into</p>
<p>this</p>
<p>so as i mentioned the first thing is</p>
<p>inside the app designer there's there's</p>
<p>two areas of where variables</p>
<p>are used</p>
<p>and you can interact with them</p>
<p>the first is obviously you need</p>
<p>administrative access or the ability to</p>
<p>manage create update the variables</p>
<p>on the left if you click the hamburger</p>
<p>you can expand the menu and see all the</p>
<p>different options you'll see a variables</p>
<p>i've got at the bottom here</p>
<p>if you do not have this option</p>
<p>it means you do not have the right to</p>
<p>maintain or change the variables as we</p>
<p>go into it</p>
<p>if you click the variables it'll</p>
<p>actually open up a different blade which</p>
<p>is listing all the variables that is</p>
<p>currently available for the apps</p>
<p>now this is where you can set up your</p>
<p>your access to the different systems</p>
<p>it's also the area where you can come</p>
<p>and actually make specific changes</p>
<p>to the variables themselves</p>
<p>so let's say you have a specific service</p>
<p>account that you're using to access</p>
<p>systemx</p>
<p>and you update the service account</p>
<p>instead of having to go through all the</p>
<p>apps</p>
<p>and try and find all the apps that users</p>
<p>have created either you know all of them</p>
<p>or you might even not know all of them</p>
<p>you can change it in one place instead</p>
<p>of having to go through all of them</p>
<p>individually</p>
<p>what the icons mean</p>
<p>is i have not actually configured</p>
<p>anything for these variables at the top</p>
<p>so there's a few options in here you can</p>
<p>manage categories</p>
<p>so you can actually create specific</p>
<p>categories all that does is allows you</p>
<p>to easily group them in this particular</p>
<p>view so you can find what you're</p>
<p>actually looking for as you go through</p>
<p>them</p>
<p>when you create variables</p>
<p>there's a few</p>
<p>options here</p>
<p>main one is around the encrypt value</p>
<p>so you give it a name provided a</p>
<p>category and the encrypt value is very</p>
<p>important</p>
<p>as you'll see when i create a connection</p>
<p>to a particular data source and i want</p>
<p>to use the variables</p>
<p>only encrypted variables will be</p>
<p>available in password fields typically</p>
<p>so if you find something is not showing</p>
<p>up in the field where you think it is</p>
<p>just make sure we've got the correct</p>
<p>encryption type</p>
<p>for that as well</p>
<p>so this is typically done</p>
<p>from a an i.t perspective typically done</p>
<p>once</p>
<p>and you don't really need to come in</p>
<p>here and edit it</p>
<p>and make any changes in it</p>
<p>however where do we actually use these</p>
<p>if i go into a particular app</p>
<p>and i'm just going to go into an</p>
<p>existing app that i have here</p>
<p>when you go into the app data and you</p>
<p>actually click the plus</p>
<p>to add</p>
<p>a new</p>
<p>data source to your your app itself</p>
<p>it's going to ask you some questions</p>
<p>so this is for a sql connector as i</p>
<p>click that it'll open up the properties</p>
<p>for me</p>
<p>over here if i open up the the next one</p>
<p>it'll open up we'll use this one's a</p>
<p>little smaller we can see everything</p>
<p>now the first thing you'll notice</p>
<p>is it has a use variables option here</p>
<p>this example we're not making uh use of</p>
<p>the the variable option the downside to</p>
<p>doing this as i've got it in here</p>
<p>means</p>
<p>i need to make a change to every single</p>
<p>app</p>
<p>if my service account details actually</p>
<p>change or the passwords change or the</p>
<p>usernames change</p>
<p>it's much better to make sure you click</p>
<p>the use variables</p>
<p>and we can now go in and we can see all</p>
<p>the different</p>
<p>options that are available</p>
<p>the ones which are not</p>
<p>password fields</p>
<p>will appear in the unencrypted so</p>
<p>typically your username your instances</p>
<p>your client id etc</p>
<p>if we go into the password field this</p>
<p>your list you'll see is a lot shorter</p>
<p>it will only show encrypted fields</p>
<p>so in this field here</p>
<p>it'll only show me and allow me to</p>
<p>select the actual password</p>
<p>field in the username it'll allow me to</p>
<p>select all the different usernames that</p>
<p>we have</p>
<p>and now i can very easily</p>
<p>make sure i select the correct database</p>
<p>and actually go from there</p>
<p>so the first area with regards to</p>
<p>variables is</p>
<p>an area that</p>
<p>is how do i access my data</p>
<p>so how do i get</p>
<p>the data in who controls that where do</p>
<p>you set that up</p>
<p>typically you you do that once um and</p>
<p>you'll go back to it over time to to</p>
<p>make some changes and adjustments to it</p>
<p>and then you use that on the actual app</p>
<p>itself so if i go into a particular page</p>
<p>as an example</p>
<p>and we want to add a new data source</p>
<p>it's going to ask me the same question</p>
<p>if i click the plus it's going to ask me</p>
<p>well where's my connection</p>
<p>if i do not have a connection and i</p>
<p>click plus there again it's going to</p>
<p>walk me through adding that connection</p>
<p>to the actual</p>
<p>app itself and i would suggest use the</p>
<p>variables in that option as well</p>
<p>so that's the one main area to use</p>
<p>variables the second area where you can</p>
<p>use variables is as i've got this</p>
<p>particular screen open</p>
<p>you'll see under page data we have a few</p>
<p>different sections so up to now we</p>
<p>pretty much just focused on the design</p>
<p>sources session or the data sources</p>
<p>section rather</p>
<p>where we can add different data sources</p>
<p>parameters allows me to define some page</p>
<p>parameters if i want to move values</p>
<p>between different pages</p>
<p>and very useful if you've got drawdowns</p>
<p>etc</p>
<p>the variables here this allows me to</p>
<p>create a variable for use in this app</p>
<p>page</p>
<p>now important to note your variables are</p>
<p>specific to the app page</p>
<p>you can't share variables between pages</p>
<p>if you want to do that</p>
<p>you need to make use of the parameters</p>
<p>and actually pass the variable down to</p>
<p>be able to use it on any drill down</p>
<p>pages that you want to use</p>
<p>so variables here are very much linked</p>
<p>to the page that we've actually got</p>
<p>in here</p>
<p>so when you create a new variable you</p>
<p>have a few options</p>
<p>for it</p>
<p>now before i go into those options</p>
<p>i did mention there were two links on</p>
<p>the the slide that i had open</p>
<p>the first link will actually walk you</p>
<p>into using the variables adding</p>
<p>variables and managing the variables</p>
<p>here</p>
<p>if you go to our documentation site so</p>
<p>documentation.xmppro.com</p>
<p>top right there's a search</p>
<p>in the search if you just search for</p>
<p>variables</p>
<p>it'll bring up all the different items</p>
<p>on variables</p>
<p>the how-to guide at the top is the one</p>
<p>that we have open now this is how can i</p>
<p>define a variable that i want to use</p>
<p>across all my apps</p>
<p>so typically your rt will set those up</p>
<p>for you</p>
<p>and then you just use them as you run</p>
<p>through the apps</p>
<p>the second area if we actually scroll</p>
<p>down</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>the search results you'll see variables</p>
<p>and expressions so the second link is</p>
<p>actually variables and expressions that</p>
<p>we've opened up over here</p>
<p>and this will walk you through how do we</p>
<p>add a new how do we edit</p>
<p>how do we configure them etc</p>
<p>but the one point i want to make here is</p>
<p>there's two modes that you can actually</p>
<p>create a variable in</p>
<p>the one mode is what we would say is a</p>
<p>value mode which means you can keep</p>
<p>updating a variable as you work through</p>
<p>the page</p>
<p>the other mode is an expression where</p>
<p>you can actually write an expression</p>
<p>which will hold the value of that</p>
<p>variable</p>
<p>now what do i actually mean by that</p>
<p>you'll see i've got two variables here</p>
<p>if i click the edit and go on to the</p>
<p>first variable you'll see here it is</p>
<p>defined as a value</p>
<p>now what that means is this variable</p>
<p>will store</p>
<p>in the the name selected time</p>
<p>anything that i actually select</p>
<p>so it is a</p>
<p>a placeholder for me to use on this</p>
<p>particular app now i've been provided a</p>
<p>value through any of the other fields</p>
<p>here that have a value option and i'll</p>
<p>show you where we're actually using it</p>
<p>on this page</p>
<p>the second variable if i click its</p>
<p>pencil this one actually opens up an</p>
<p>expression</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>how we change that is you click the</p>
<p>value you go to expression it'll give</p>
<p>you the expression</p>
<p>now what's important here when you are</p>
<p>creating variables make sure your data</p>
<p>types are correct</p>
<p>um any of the</p>
<p>parameters operations functions that</p>
<p>you're trying to do here are specific to</p>
<p>the data type it's not going to allow</p>
<p>you to save this if you're trying to</p>
<p>you know convert text into a date time</p>
<p>or integer and it's not compatible so</p>
<p>always make sure your date time is</p>
<p>correct</p>
<p>this particular expression here is</p>
<p>adding days to the exact same variable</p>
<p>that we've selected at the top</p>
<p>we are then getting the date difference</p>
<p>and we are using a local time so how do</p>
<p>we actually create this</p>
<p>all expressions in the app designer</p>
<p>follow a very similar approach</p>
<p>you have access to your parameters if</p>
<p>you have any defined if you click</p>
<p>variables you can actually see the</p>
<p>variables will be listed here</p>
<p>how you add them to the expression</p>
<p>editor if i just push enter a few times</p>
<p>to given you a few new lines</p>
<p>if you double click the time</p>
<p>it'll actually fill in the values in the</p>
<p>expression editor for you automatically</p>
<p>again you just double click time and</p>
<p>it'll fill that in for you you don't</p>
<p>have to figure out how do i type it out</p>
<p>um what's the correct spelling i need to</p>
<p>use etc just double click anything in</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>editor at the bottom and it'll add it to</p>
<p>the top for you as well</p>
<p>constants</p>
<p>um when we are talking about true false</p>
<p>is mobile um how do we define constants</p>
<p>and use them as well</p>
<p>functions anything that you want to do</p>
<p>from a daytime logical you know maths</p>
<p>business role</p>
<p>etc will be in constant functions and</p>
<p>then you have operators coming down the</p>
<p>bottom and here as well</p>
<p>so the date time you have a lot of</p>
<p>options in here</p>
<p>if we go all the way down to the</p>
<p>add days</p>
<p>if i click on that so single click not a</p>
<p>double click if i double click it'll add</p>
<p>it into the editor at the top</p>
<p>if i single click it</p>
<p>it'll actually bring up the help text</p>
<p>for me on the right</p>
<p>so it'll give me a explanation of what</p>
<p>it's expecting</p>
<p>and it'll also give me a description of</p>
<p>what it is trying to do</p>
<p>so if i go into the logical and i click</p>
<p>the if as an example you'll see there</p>
<p>it'll give you just a breakdown of what</p>
<p>it's expecting</p>
<p>and then a brief description of what</p>
<p>it's looking for</p>
<p>if i double click the if</p>
<p>it'll fall that in for me</p>
<p>i can now click into a particular area</p>
<p>and i can go into the variables and i</p>
<p>can actually use a variable in there as</p>
<p>well</p>
<p>so we're just going to discard those</p>
<p>changes for now</p>
<p>and we'll come back to that</p>
<p>so selected time again this is just</p>
<p>defined as a value which means we're</p>
<p>going to keep updating its value for it</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>what do i mean by that if i just open up</p>
<p>another</p>
<p>tab here and i just go into this actual</p>
<p>app itself so we can see what it is</p>
<p>displaying</p>
<p>so as the app loads you'll see i have</p>
<p>data live data coming through i have</p>
<p>live data coming through but i have a</p>
<p>drop down at the top here</p>
<p>and i have certain fields in this drop</p>
<p>down as well</p>
<p>if i select anything in the drop down</p>
<p>what you'll notice is i am now not</p>
<p>getting my loud data anymore</p>
<p>but i've got a specific snapshot in time</p>
<p>that i'm viewing because i've selected</p>
<p>at the top</p>
<p>if i go and delete that and tab out of</p>
<p>that you'll see it'll bring back my live</p>
<p>view as well</p>
<p>this was done using a combination of</p>
<p>variables and expressions so let's break</p>
<p>this down</p>
<p>if i come back into this particular</p>
<p>app itself the first thing is we've got</p>
<p>the selected time defined</p>
<p>the second thing is on our date selector</p>
<p>at the top if we go to its properties</p>
<p>you will see in its properties here</p>
<p>we've got appearance</p>
<p>we've got behavior where we want to go</p>
<p>into is value</p>
<p>typically when you will drag this on its</p>
<p>value</p>
<p>would be using the static option</p>
<p>if you click that it'll swap to a</p>
<p>dynamic option</p>
<p>and in the drop down you'll be able to</p>
<p>select the variable</p>
<p>so what we're doing here is we're saying</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>whatever i'm selecting as a user in this</p>
<p>drop down</p>
<p>we need to make that information</p>
<p>available into this variable so getting</p>
<p>it's getting stored into that variable</p>
<p>itself so</p>
<p>if i select in this drop down to 12 am</p>
<p>my variable when i say 12 am if i do</p>
<p>that to the 12 20 it'll have the 1220.</p>
<p>so how do we actually see that how do we</p>
<p>know it's doing that</p>
<p>but across the top we're just going to</p>
<p>edit the the particular app so i'm just</p>
<p>going to create</p>
<p>a new</p>
<p>label we've just cloned the first one</p>
<p>we're just going to give it some spacing</p>
<p>on the left</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>instead of it having the the words of</p>
<p>pump data in there</p>
<p>we are going to</p>
<p>set it to variable.time</p>
<p>uh actually select the time that's what</p>
<p>i'm interested in</p>
<p>so now if we go back to the actual app</p>
<p>itself and we refresh this</p>
<p>there's no value currently for that</p>
<p>particular field</p>
<p>if i select something in</p>
<p>you'll see</p>
<p>i now have a</p>
<p>a value that has been selected</p>
<p>for it</p>
<p>if i go down it'll select the next one</p>
<p>and if i keep going down it'll select</p>
<p>the next one as well</p>
<p>because we are dealing with date times</p>
<p>it's going to bring up the raw date time</p>
<p>information for me as well that's why</p>
<p>it's very important to make sure you're</p>
<p>using the correct data sources and</p>
<p>you're not trying to do this as a string</p>
<p>when it should be a data or string when</p>
<p>it should be an integer or a double or a</p>
<p>long so very important there</p>
<p>so again</p>
<p>if i come back and reload this the first</p>
<p>time you'll notice that nothing will be</p>
<p>displayed</p>
<p>until i actually select something in the</p>
<p>field that i've got coming in as soon as</p>
<p>i select something it'll make that value</p>
<p>available into that field which is</p>
<p>across the top there and i can now use</p>
<p>it on any of the other fields on the</p>
<p>form that i want to</p>
<p>so where is this actually being used</p>
<p>so we're just going to get rid of the</p>
<p>top</p>
<p>and we're going to come back to the</p>
<p>actual date selector itself</p>
<p>and we go into the box</p>
<p>we can just minimize all the items</p>
<p>the the two boxes that we've actually</p>
<p>got here</p>
<p>if i highlight the one and how i know</p>
<p>they've got data bound to them is they</p>
<p>have a yellow border around them as well</p>
<p>so looking at this page i can see that</p>
<p>there is data for them</p>
<p>so that is how i know to look at them</p>
<p>for their data sources so if i just</p>
<p>click the one that we're looking at here</p>
<p>you'll see this is bound to its pump</p>
<p>history data</p>
<p>however</p>
<p>the visible we're actually using a quick</p>
<p>expression value</p>
<p>so again if we come back to variables</p>
<p>the first one</p>
<p>we were using it as a value</p>
<p>the second one we were using the</p>
<p>expression editor here and we're going</p>
<p>to add some days when you've selected it</p>
<p>and we're going to convert it</p>
<p>etc</p>
<p>so you're using expression editor as</p>
<p>part of the variable itself</p>
<p>the other way you can use this as well</p>
<p>is on any of the fields</p>
<p>that allow you to change static to</p>
<p>dynamic to quick expression you can use</p>
<p>the expression editor as well</p>
<p>so typically this field looking at it</p>
<p>here you would have a true or false</p>
<p>however we only want this to display</p>
<p>if you have selected something in the</p>
<p>top</p>
<p>we could</p>
<p>bind it to a variable</p>
<p>and we could have the variable handle</p>
<p>that as well</p>
<p>but what we're going to do in this</p>
<p>instance if i click that as a second</p>
<p>time it's actually going to give me the</p>
<p>quick expression value field</p>
<p>if you click into that field</p>
<p>you'll see exactly the same window pops</p>
<p>up</p>
<p>it's exactly the same window</p>
<p>that popped up when we were doing this</p>
<p>on the variable side</p>
<p>if you click parameters</p>
<p>variables you can see my two variables i</p>
<p>have all my constants i have all my</p>
<p>functions coming in here as well</p>
<p>so typically you would have your static</p>
<p>value</p>
<p>you would check the one to be able to</p>
<p>select something either on the data</p>
<p>source that binds around you</p>
<p>or on the actual variables or parameters</p>
<p>or if you click it again you get access</p>
<p>to the quick expression value this one</p>
<p>here is</p>
<p>using a conditional check</p>
<p>if that variable</p>
<p>is a valid date</p>
<p>then it's going to use it on this</p>
<p>particular data source in here as well</p>
<p>if it is not a valid date then it is</p>
<p>going to</p>
<p>set the visibility of this to false so</p>
<p>this here you'll see there's actually</p>
<p>two boxes in this example</p>
<p>all it's doing is it's taking the one</p>
<p>making the one visible</p>
<p>and taking the other one making the</p>
<p>other one invisible</p>
<p>for it</p>
<p>these particular boxes here have a data</p>
<p>source and on the filter</p>
<p>here you can see we're actually using</p>
<p>that variable as well</p>
<p>when you create any filters</p>
<p>or any of the the options uh in here and</p>
<p>you're using the filter control</p>
<p>it'll default to the static</p>
<p>value</p>
<p>if you click that</p>
<p>again</p>
<p>it'll turn into</p>
<p>a selectable so it's more of a dynamic</p>
<p>option</p>
<p>here</p>
<p>you can see there's the data source</p>
<p>around it but we're interested in the</p>
<p>variable</p>
<p>so we can actually define and select</p>
<p>that variable that we're interested in</p>
<p>in here as well</p>
<p>so variables can be used and have their</p>
<p>values assigned</p>
<p>by interacting with different fields on</p>
<p>the form and to do that</p>
<p>on the actual control that you want to</p>
<p>update the variable</p>
<p>you need to make sure that you set its</p>
<p>value to that variable</p>
<p>you can then use this variable</p>
<p>in different ways one of them in a</p>
<p>filter</p>
<p>which is what we've got in here so again</p>
<p>if i go all the way up here and i go to</p>
<p>its filter you'll see a variable gets</p>
<p>used in this filter as well</p>
<p>you can use it again</p>
<p>in anything that has a static to a</p>
<p>dynamic to a quick expression editor in</p>
<p>here as</p>
<p>well</p>
<p>one more area you can use expressions i</p>
<p>just discard all those changes coming in</p>
<p>here</p>
<p>and we can close the filter there we go</p>
<p>on the page data side</p>
<p>you'll see i have my pump data so i have</p>
<p>all my data coming through</p>
<p>from a particular data source so if i</p>
<p>click the pencil you'll see this is</p>
<p>coming from a data stream</p>
<p>what you can also do here is you can</p>
<p>create expressions on this data source</p>
<p>as well so what i want to do here</p>
<p>i'm going to call it indicator color</p>
<p>we're going to keep it as a string and</p>
<p>i'm going to go into functions</p>
<p>we're going to use the if</p>
<p>so here what we're going to say is if</p>
<p>and what you'll see is because i'm in a</p>
<p>data source</p>
<p>i have a new section called fields</p>
<p>available</p>
<p>if you are not in the data source you</p>
<p>will not get the fields option but what</p>
<p>this allows me to do is interact with</p>
<p>these fields</p>
<p>coming through here</p>
<p>so what i can do</p>
<p>is let's have a look at</p>
<p>the data flowing through here</p>
<p>what we want to do is just put a simple</p>
<p>conditional clause in there that if my</p>
<p>temperature goes above</p>
<p>let's say 95 for long drive end</p>
<p>so if my non-drive in temperature again</p>
<p>click where you want</p>
<p>double click so if my non-drive</p>
<p>temperature is upwards of 95</p>
<p>then what we want to do is we want this</p>
<p>to be red otherwise</p>
<p>we want this to be green</p>
<p>we can click save</p>
<p>what we're doing here is we're creating</p>
<p>a</p>
<p>expression on the data source</p>
<p>itself so</p>
<p>right at the bottom indicator color was</p>
<p>not available in the original data</p>
<p>source however there are conditions</p>
<p>there is logic</p>
<p>i actually want to use the conditional</p>
<p>indicator now so now what i can do is i</p>
<p>can have a look at the actual</p>
<p>item</p>
<p>here</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>if i select</p>
<p>the box in question</p>
<p>this is bound to the pump data</p>
<p>i'm going to just move this</p>
<p>up a little bit so we can actually see</p>
<p>what it looks like</p>
<p>and we are going to drag on an indicator</p>
<p>i'll just put it at the top</p>
<p>for now</p>
<p>now on the indicator you'll see i have</p>
<p>the color option here i can provide a</p>
<p>static color</p>
<p>if i click that i then get access into</p>
<p>the data source</p>
<p>because there's a data source that is</p>
<p>sitting around this particular</p>
<p>indicator there is my indicator color</p>
<p>i know it's a expression because of the</p>
<p>fx i can actually click that and now i</p>
<p>can use that</p>
<p>in my my app itself</p>
<p>so if i just save that</p>
<p>and we just refresh the app</p>
<p>you'll see the color will start changing</p>
<p>as the condition</p>
<p>is met that i've actually defined for it</p>
<p>in as well</p>
<p>so the color indicator you could</p>
<p>work that color out in an actual data</p>
<p>stream there's nothing wrong with doing</p>
<p>it there</p>
<p>you can also do it within the app</p>
<p>designer on the actual data source</p>
<p>itself like we've done over here</p>
<p>you can get a lot more complex in your</p>
<p>expressions using the functions</p>
<p>using the constants using the fields etc</p>
<p>another example of what you could do is</p>
<p>if i go into the variables here and i</p>
<p>say</p>
<p>i just want to create a variable called</p>
<p>full name</p>
<p>for for the user again it's going to be</p>
<p>a string</p>
<p>and we can say expression</p>
<p>if we go into constants you'll see there</p>
<p>is a first name there is a last name if</p>
<p>i double click first name it'll fill</p>
<p>that in for me</p>
<p>we're just going to add a space in there</p>
<p>and double click last name</p>
<p>for that as well and click save</p>
<p>so creating variables is very easy</p>
<p>the the one thing to keep in mind is</p>
<p>what are you wanting to use the variable</p>
<p>for um and where do you want to update</p>
<p>it and where do you want to</p>
<p>use it in a filter etc</p>
<p>if i go into the top here again and</p>
<p>we're just going to create a</p>
<p>little space here</p>
<p>this one here we're again going to click</p>
<p>the static</p>
<p>and in there we are just going to use</p>
<p>the full name</p>
<p>and if we refresh to see what that</p>
<p>actually looks like</p>
<p>you'll see it'll bring</p>
<p>the full name coming through</p>
<p>for a variable which means if i now need</p>
<p>to update the data source or pass this</p>
<p>down into a system that i'm trying to</p>
<p>integrate with or update</p>
<p>or insert i can actually pass who was</p>
<p>the user through there as well using a</p>
<p>variable</p>
<p>thank you for your for your time today</p>
<p>um and for attending another lunch and</p>
<p>learn</p>
<p>one thing to remember we only touched on</p>
<p>two of the areas of variable use these</p>
<p>are mainly used inside the app designer</p>
<p>there is a third inside the data stream</p>
<p>designer which we'll get to in a future</p>
<p>lunch and learn</p>
<p>thank you again for the time</p>
