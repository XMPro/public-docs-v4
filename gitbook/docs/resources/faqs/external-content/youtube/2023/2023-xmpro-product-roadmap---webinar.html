<p>Join XMPro Development Manager, Daniel King as he takes you through our highly anticipated product roadmap covering the Now, Next, and Later product releases.</p>
<details>
<summary>Transcript</summary>welcome to the XM Pro product roadmap
<p>webinar for 2023 I'm Daniel King</p>
<p>development manager at XM Pro I'm based</p>
<p>in Sunshine Coast Queensland Australia</p>
<p>and I'd like to thank you all for taking</p>
<p>the time to attend today</p>
<p>I have a lot to cover off today so if</p>
<p>you have any questions please send them</p>
<p>through and I'll try to answer them at</p>
<p>the end</p>
<p>2023 has been an amazing year so far and</p>
<p>I can't believe it's halfway already</p>
<p>I won't be recapping recently delivered</p>
<p>items in this session but I'd like to</p>
<p>encourage you to go to our website and</p>
<p>check out our latest release notes</p>
<p>there are three key achievements I would</p>
<p>like to call out though 83 of our agency</p>
<p>connectors have been contributed to so</p>
<p>far this year which is massive I'll be</p>
<p>partnered with Dell Technologies to</p>
<p>create a validated design for the</p>
<p>manufacturing Edge and work with Nvidia</p>
<p>to validate XM Pro as GPU enabled or</p>
<p>accelerated and Enterprise ready</p>
<p>I'd like to take a second here to thank</p>
<p>the XM pro team for their contributions</p>
<p>and making all this happen I know a few</p>
<p>of them are watching today so thank you</p>
<p>the intelligent digital twins framework</p>
<p>is a strategy for our product</p>
<p>Peter Van scope fake is CEO of XM Pro</p>
<p>and co-chair for the natural resources</p>
<p>of working group at the digital twin</p>
<p>Consortium</p>
<p>here goes into much more detail on our</p>
<p>strategy and if you haven't already</p>
<p>watched this previous webinar I'd highly</p>
<p>recommend you do so you can find it on</p>
<p>our XM Pro channel in YouTube</p>
<p>the i3c framework is a longer term view</p>
<p>of where we're heading</p>
<p>and the product roadmap represents the</p>
<p>items we're working on now and next to</p>
<p>get us there I won't be able to cover</p>
<p>everything on a roadmap in 30 minutes</p>
<p>but I'll try my best to cover as much as</p>
<p>I can today</p>
<p>four pillars of the XM Pro product are</p>
<p>how we execute on the i3c framework</p>
<p>together they support each of our three</p>
<p>themes faster time to Value distributed</p>
<p>intelligence and secure cost deployments</p>
<p>the triangle layout demonstrates how</p>
<p>each of these Builders support each</p>
<p>other</p>
<p>and the pillars have varying impact on</p>
<p>people processing Technology based on</p>
<p>their proximity to these little labels</p>
<p>here</p>
<p>the robot items will be grouped by</p>
<p>pillar and I'll be talking through each</p>
<p>roadmap item for each of these pillars</p>
<p>distributed intelligence is achieved</p>
<p>through Ai and Engineering where people</p>
<p>and Technology meet to innovate execute</p>
<p>and augment with AI</p>
<p>I think that's pretty cool</p>
<p>we're going to start today with AI and</p>
<p>Engineering pillar</p>
<p>47 of all iot applications will be AI</p>
<p>infused in 2027. that's a 30 increase in</p>
<p>under four years that's that's that's</p>
<p>amazing we want to enable our customers</p>
<p>to be part of that 47 percent</p>
<p>and we're doing this with a number of AI</p>
<p>roadmap items</p>
<p>so we're going to focus on Innovation</p>
<p>with AI first</p>
<p>AI is fast growing and disrupting</p>
<p>markets around us and it offers new</p>
<p>tools to do things differently but these</p>
<p>tools are rapidly changing this is why</p>
<p>we think Innovation with AI is critical</p>
<p>X and pro notebooks is a new product</p>
<p>we'll be releasing as part of our AI</p>
<p>offering it supports Jupiter notebooks</p>
<p>allowing you to use a well-established</p>
<p>product without having to retrain people</p>
<p>or refactor existing notebooks XM Pro</p>
<p>notebooks can be used in data science</p>
<p>scientific Computing and machine</p>
<p>learning and data scientists analysts</p>
<p>and Engineers will be able to access</p>
<p>data to innovate within the XM Pro Suite</p>
<p>each user will have their own dedicated</p>
<p>notebook actively using the product this</p>
<p>makes it very scalable and cost</p>
<p>effective as you experiment</p>
<p>one of the biggest challenges for data</p>
<p>scientists is the access to good data to</p>
<p>innovate with</p>
<p>we're adding integration to our data</p>
<p>stream data so excellent Pro notebooks</p>
<p>can access the rich and near real-time</p>
<p>data in transit</p>
<p>this scenario isn't just limited</p>
<p>real-time data though in data streams</p>
<p>you can also run simulations on your</p>
<p>data streams and access that same data</p>
<p>from Maximum code notebooks the same way</p>
<p>this approach also allows users to focus</p>
<p>on innovation without first having to</p>
<p>develop software and Integrations up</p>
<p>front</p>
<p>it also allows for continuous innovation</p>
<p>and experimentation over time</p>
<p>we currently support the ability to run</p>
<p>simulations on streams visualize the</p>
<p>results in apps</p>
<p>front running simulations is the ability</p>
<p>to run a simulated event just before the</p>
<p>real event to predict what that result</p>
<p>would be</p>
<p>and this example we're simulating an</p>
<p>event right before the real event to see</p>
<p>what the outcome would be and in this</p>
<p>case it would have been a bad outcome</p>
<p>this allows you to build functionality</p>
<p>into a stream to modify the path</p>
<p>an event takes ultimately ensuring that</p>
<p>you get a good outcome</p>
<p>so let's talk about when these things</p>
<p>are coming so the now Title Here</p>
<p>represents an item that's actively in</p>
<p>development or scheduled for release</p>
<p>soon and the next title represents work</p>
<p>with developers not yet commenced or is</p>
<p>blocked by another item</p>
<p>we practice hypothesis driven</p>
<p>development at xmpros this means that</p>
<p>items can shift or change the scope</p>
<p>based on what we learned</p>
<p>development for the X and pro notebooks</p>
<p>has completed and the team are working</p>
<p>on productizing it for our supported</p>
<p>platforms and</p>
<p>Cloud providers</p>
<p>it will be the first available on our</p>
<p>free trial offering which is probably</p>
<p>only days away at this stage or really</p>
<p>close and it'll become available</p>
<p>incrementally on our installers for</p>
<p>different clouds and platforms</p>
<p>next we'll be releasing support to</p>
<p>consume stream data in those notebooks</p>
<p>and we're in the early stages of</p>
<p>planning for this</p>
<p>front running simulations is also in the</p>
<p>early stages of planning</p>
<p>once you've innovated and produced new</p>
<p>AI Solutions you need a way to execute</p>
<p>them</p>
<p>running AI in our streams is one way to</p>
<p>do this and up until recently you'll be</p>
<p>limited running these on the CPU</p>
<p>the GPU is well suited for running</p>
<p>certain workloads and involve a lot of</p>
<p>concurrent processing</p>
<p>moving processing to the GPU can vastly</p>
<p>improve how much processing you can do</p>
<p>in the same time frame compared to the</p>
<p>CPU mathematical algorithms Machine</p>
<p>Vision neural networks and deep learning</p>
<p>are examples of workloads that involve a</p>
<p>lot of concurrent processing</p>
<p>in this example we're using a Machine</p>
<p>Vision to process apples and oranges</p>
<p>differently in our data stream</p>
<p>images of our fruit are ingested by a</p>
<p>data stream as an agent compares the</p>
<p>images pixel by pixel to determine if</p>
<p>the if it's an apple or an orange</p>
<p>by using the GPU to run pixel comparison</p>
<p>algorithms we can process a lot more</p>
<p>images</p>
<p>this stream can still be run on the edge</p>
<p>Fogle cloud</p>
<p>and it can also dynamically detect if</p>
<p>there's a compatible Nvidia GPU and use</p>
<p>it falling back to the CPU when the GPU</p>
<p>isn't available</p>
<p>there are a handful of scripting</p>
<p>languages that are fast becoming</p>
<p>standard for executing AO workloads by</p>
<p>supporting these scripting languages we</p>
<p>support customers in running their</p>
<p>existing Solutions in our streams this</p>
<p>reduces the need to refactor or retrain</p>
<p>staff and you can adopt new</p>
<p>functionality faster as is the large</p>
<p>open source Community currently</p>
<p>innovating using these scripting</p>
<p>languages</p>
<p>we're extending our current agents to</p>
<p>support more of these scripting</p>
<p>languages</p>
<p>we're also adding support for more</p>
<p>governments around these scripts in this</p>
<p>example you can see we can run a script</p>
<p>directly in an agent or reference the</p>
<p>latest published version of a script</p>
<p>from the common storage layer</p>
<p>for now I think of the common storage</p>
<p>layers kind of like GitHub and I'll talk</p>
<p>about this later</p>
<p>these scripts can be edited from the X</p>
<p>and pro notebooks allowing users to</p>
<p>operate completely in our suite of</p>
<p>products</p>
<p>data streams are executed for us to buy</p>
<p>our stream hosts and these stream hosts</p>
<p>can be run on the edge of fog and Cloud</p>
<p>allowing you to distribute your</p>
<p>processing fully strict scripts uh</p>
<p>providing like a very flexible and</p>
<p>composable architecture</p>
<p>thank you now we've recognize you may</p>
<p>have your own machine learning</p>
<p>operations or mlops</p>
<p>they're focused on streamlining the</p>
<p>process of taking machine learning</p>
<p>models to product and then maintaining</p>
<p>and monitoring them</p>
<p>mlop space it's it's growing very</p>
<p>quickly and there's a vast variety of</p>
<p>different third-party Solutions our</p>
<p>approach here is to create agents to</p>
<p>integrate these third-party Solutions</p>
<p>mlflow is our open source platform for</p>
<p>managing the end-to-end machine learning</p>
<p>life cycle</p>
<p>and is fast becoming the the most</p>
<p>popular in the space</p>
<p>we have created an ml flow agent that</p>
<p>can get the latest published version of</p>
<p>a model</p>
<p>and invoke it with data from the our</p>
<p>data stream and then return those</p>
<p>results back this prevents the the need</p>
<p>for a data science to actually go into a</p>
<p>data stream and update that stream each</p>
<p>time a new version of the model is</p>
<p>created</p>
<p>it also allows heavy processing of ml</p>
<p>models to be run on the customer systems</p>
<p>optimize already for these workloads</p>
<p>it also allows access to be restricted</p>
<p>to the data stream supporting the</p>
<p>principle of least privilege</p>
<p>mlops can be orchestrated from XM Pro</p>
<p>notebooks allowing you to run</p>
<p>experiments create models publish those</p>
<p>models and then invoke them directly</p>
<p>from The Notebook then using the results</p>
<p>foreign</p>
<p>GPU acceleration support is currently</p>
<p>available you can design Aid install</p>
<p>leverage Nvidia gpus using agent</p>
<p>documentation and we'll be extending</p>
<p>this documentation to provide more</p>
<p>examples and support</p>
<p>we're also working on adding GPU</p>
<p>acceleration support to some of our</p>
<p>existing agents</p>
<p>we currently have a python script and</p>
<p>we're close to releasing an R script</p>
<p>agent we'll be adding more governance</p>
<p>controls and integration to these to</p>
<p>these scripts using the common storage</p>
<p>layer after it's released and I'll talk</p>
<p>about talk more about that common source</p>
<p>layer layer later</p>
<p>we've recently developed the ml for</p>
<p>agent for integrating to customer lmops</p>
<p>and we're updating our public docs right</p>
<p>now before we actually release it</p>
<p>now the innovating and executing with AI</p>
<p>there's a great opportunity to augment</p>
<p>what we have now with these results</p>
<p>we currently have recommendations</p>
<p>capability and for those that aren't</p>
<p>familiar at a very high level you can</p>
<p>create recommendations with rules that</p>
<p>when are met generate alerts</p>
<p>we found that existing recommendations</p>
<p>can be augmented with AI anomalies can</p>
<p>be dynamically detected and visualized</p>
<p>with inside the recommendations</p>
<p>new recommendations can be automatically</p>
<p>generated or discovered</p>
<p>and rules within those recommendations</p>
<p>can be created or augmented</p>
<p>and alerts themselves can be augmented</p>
<p>with copilot like functionality and</p>
<p>assisting assisting engineers in in</p>
<p>resolving these alerts</p>
<p>chat GTP and open API services are</p>
<p>continuing to provide new and easier</p>
<p>innovative ways of doing things</p>
<p>accent Pro notebooks will be released</p>
<p>with a sample notebook demonstrating</p>
<p>integration to chat GTP in this sample</p>
<p>notebook it includes an end-to-end beer</p>
<p>quality example which incorporates chat</p>
<p>GTP and who doesn't like quality beer</p>
<p>data stream designer Integrations will</p>
<p>allow you to augment your event data</p>
<p>with chat GTP and app designer</p>
<p>Integrations will allow you to make</p>
<p>custom calls</p>
<p>from your apps enabling co-pilot like</p>
<p>functionality</p>
<p>the security of our data we will we uh</p>
<p>security fuel data and and how we</p>
<p>implement this is really important to us</p>
<p>we use the third-party services like GTP</p>
<p>takes a lot of our consideration and</p>
<p>we'll be factoring this into you know</p>
<p>how we solve these problems and deliver</p>
<p>these new product roadmap items</p>
<p>visualization of AI outputs is a really</p>
<p>powerful and effective way of</p>
<p>communicating the insights you're making</p>
<p>excellent Pro notebooks will allow you</p>
<p>to generate visualizations that you can</p>
<p>share in apps in this example we'll be</p>
<p>using chuckttp to generate a linear</p>
<p>regression visualization for us</p>
<p>it's using the data for my data streams</p>
<p>and it's checking to be savings a lot of</p>
<p>time because we're not having to find</p>
<p>the suitable libraries and write the</p>
<p>code to do this ourselves</p>
<p>Excel Pro notebooks will be released</p>
<p>with chat GTB integration support and</p>
<p>samples on how to get going quickly you</p>
<p>can currently integrate you integrate to</p>
<p>check GTP via our Python scripts and run</p>
<p>these in agents right now</p>
<p>and these Python scripts can be designed</p>
<p>and managed in X and pro notebooks</p>
<p>we will have importable end-to-end</p>
<p>Solutions as our starting point to get</p>
<p>you going faster for our common use</p>
<p>cases and additionally planning for app</p>
<p>designer and data stream designer</p>
<p>integration</p>
<p>as this is currently underway and it</p>
<p>will provide more additional no code</p>
<p>approaches</p>
<p>AI generated or discovered</p>
<p>recommendations is in the early stages</p>
<p>of planning there are some core</p>
<p>technical pieces that are needed before</p>
<p>we can start this work and the</p>
<p>development team are busy work on these</p>
<p>right now</p>
<p>generating analytics and visualizations</p>
<p>is currently available through a mix of</p>
<p>approaches we're currently planning on</p>
<p>how to extend these approaches to closer</p>
<p>integrate x and pro notebooks allowing</p>
<p>from a more seamless experiment</p>
<p>experience from right through from</p>
<p>Innovation through to augmentation and</p>
<p>the visualization</p>
<p>all these new AI roadmap items need</p>
<p>distributed computing and network</p>
<p>infrastructure management to support an</p>
<p>edge ecosystem</p>
<p>this is the cloud to Edge continuum</p>
<p>we currently support deployments to a</p>
<p>wide variety of cloud providers and</p>
<p>on-prem platforms using cloud and</p>
<p>platform native services</p>
<p>this creates additional overhead for us</p>
<p>and our customers as we add more</p>
<p>features demanding more capabilities in</p>
<p>this area</p>
<p>these environments can be configured in</p>
<p>many different ways and also change and</p>
<p>sometimes without our control and this</p>
<p>makes it difficult for us to deploy and</p>
<p>support our products simply as</p>
<p>seamlessly</p>
<p>there are new more modern approaches</p>
<p>that are quickly become industry</p>
<p>standard for the type of architecture</p>
<p>that underpins our suite of products</p>
<p>these more modern approaches require us</p>
<p>to change our deployments to embrace</p>
<p>them</p>
<p>we'll be creating a cloud agnostic</p>
<p>deployment for our suite of products</p>
<p>that will become the default deployment</p>
<p>method</p>
<p>the aim is to provide a product that is</p>
<p>more portable allowing for business</p>
<p>better business continuity planning more</p>
<p>reliable with self-healing properties</p>
<p>and more performant allowing for better</p>
<p>performance for Less cost</p>
<p>now we currently support distributed</p>
<p>deployment and in this example we have</p>
<p>products used most by our users in the</p>
<p>cloud in regions closest to those users</p>
<p>making the products feel fast and snappy</p>
<p>in the fog we have our AI capabilities</p>
<p>closest to where most of our data is</p>
<p>reducing the time to transmit large</p>
<p>volumes of data over the wire and on the</p>
<p>edge we have our stream hosts these are</p>
<p>our engines that run our data streams by</p>
<p>putting them on the edge we put them</p>
<p>closest with the devices and Edge</p>
<p>systems are</p>
<p>the challenge with this approach is</p>
<p>managing all these Edge deployments</p>
<p>without some form of centralized</p>
<p>monitoring alerting and management it</p>
<p>can become difficult and time consuming</p>
<p>for iot to manage these systems</p>
<p>this is why we're building support for</p>
<p>third-party systems that provides</p>
<p>centralized monitoring alerting and</p>
<p>management capabilities</p>
<p>we're adopting industry standards and</p>
<p>best practices to allow us to easily add</p>
<p>additional providers over time and this</p>
<p>also provides customers with the</p>
<p>flexibility to use their existing</p>
<p>providers if they have them</p>
<p>the solution would be composable with</p>
<p>the ability to select different</p>
<p>providers from different functions</p>
<p>instead of having to commit to one</p>
<p>system to do it all</p>
<p>we're bringing devsecops capabilities to</p>
<p>our sweeter products</p>
<p>we're not building these capabilities</p>
<p>into our products but again leveraging</p>
<p>existing industry standards and best</p>
<p>practices to allow you to use your own</p>
<p>providers</p>
<p>in this example we have a pre-pro</p>
<p>environment that we want to design our</p>
<p>streams and apps before we publish them</p>
<p>to production</p>
<p>these new versions of apps and streams</p>
<p>are automatically exported to the common</p>
<p>storage layer and from there UI test</p>
<p>automation can be run leveraging our XM</p>
<p>Pro test automation Library</p>
<p>secure testing can be performed on any</p>
<p>changes to say Integrations to mitigate</p>
<p>any potential vulnerabilities and when</p>
<p>all these pre-checks pass the change is</p>
<p>then approved and these versions can be</p>
<p>published to our products or your</p>
<p>product environment or the customer</p>
<p>support environment</p>
<p>we can take a similar approach to</p>
<p>upgrades to X and pro new versions can</p>
<p>be automatically and programmatically</p>
<p>installed in pre-prod manual regression</p>
<p>or just automated UI testing performed</p>
<p>and then deployed to production</p>
<p>we've just released automated database</p>
<p>installs and upgrades</p>
<p>which allows for a fully automated</p>
<p>deployment our current deployment</p>
<p>options required a customer though to</p>
<p>set up Automation in their third-party</p>
<p>systems</p>
<p>best practices have evolved since some</p>
<p>parts of the process were first</p>
<p>developed and we need to redesign these</p>
<p>and we'll provide be providing improved</p>
<p>deployment automation incrementally</p>
<p>product by product</p>
<p>we've completed several proof of</p>
<p>Concepts around Cloud agnostic</p>
<p>deployment</p>
<p>with commence development and are taking</p>
<p>our product by product approach and</p>
<p>we'll continue to support cloud data for</p>
<p>some time shifting to Cloud agnostic</p>
<p>deployments as default and they're done</p>
<p>we're looking to cater for customers who</p>
<p>want an out-of-the-box experiments where</p>
<p>they can use all the default deployment</p>
<p>configuration that we provide right</p>
<p>through to those that want to consume</p>
<p>the individual product artifacts and</p>
<p>build them into their own custom</p>
<p>deployment</p>
<p>we've completed a proof of concept I</p>
<p>distributed deployment management based</p>
<p>on our Cloud agnostic approach and we're</p>
<p>in the planning state of considering a</p>
<p>mix of internal and external third-party</p>
<p>tooling to be rolled out incrementally</p>
<p>faster time to value is achieved through</p>
<p>roadmap items that combine people</p>
<p>and process to accelerate transformation</p>
<p>we're providing more support for what</p>
<p>you have when it comes to visualizations</p>
<p>we use blocks to compose apps and</p>
<p>already have a large library of blocks</p>
<p>to do this however some scenarios it's</p>
<p>quite difficult to create a block for</p>
<p>example</p>
<p>if a customer system uses an</p>
<p>incompatible technology or uses an old</p>
<p>technology that performs slowly or is</p>
<p>just custom or an in-house system</p>
<p>meta blocks will allow us or you to</p>
<p>create custom blocks to overcome these</p>
<p>challenges</p>
<p>it'll allow you to run visualizations</p>
<p>side by side that traditionally just</p>
<p>wouldn't be possible</p>
<p>with this capability you will be able to</p>
<p>create an industrial metaverse that runs</p>
<p>on the same backbone of event data</p>
<p>without first needing to re-platform</p>
<p>your existing exist existing systems to</p>
<p>like a common technology</p>
<p>this gives you the flexibility to delay</p>
<p>deciding when that common technology</p>
<p>needs to be and what it needs to be</p>
<p>until that Industrial metaverse</p>
<p>Technologies and processes stabilize and</p>
<p>you can make a better decision about</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>I've mentioned the common storage layer</p>
<p>a number of times already in this</p>
<p>presentation</p>
<p>and that's because it will unite</p>
<p>artifacts across XM Pro think of it as</p>
<p>kind of like GitHub</p>
<p>except we'll be implementing it in a way</p>
<p>that allow you to choose the provider so</p>
<p>it doesn't have to be GitHub it'll also</p>
<p>be comprised of several different</p>
<p>Technologies allowing for the best</p>
<p>technology for the job and using best</p>
<p>practices to do it</p>
<p>the common storage layout will allow you</p>
<p>to collaborate faster and safer</p>
<p>providing well-known interfaces and</p>
<p>governance controls to do this</p>
<p>anything you can currently export or</p>
<p>import can be managed here and all the</p>
<p>new artifacts discussed today will be</p>
<p>stored here</p>
<p>the provider you choose for the common</p>
<p>storage layer will also support</p>
<p>integration most likely and allowing you</p>
<p>to automate and tie in artifacts from</p>
<p>Max and pro into your current existing</p>
<p>systems</p>
<p>we're introducing some new artifacts the</p>
<p>common series later get you started</p>
<p>quicker and keep you innovating</p>
<p>blueprints are pre-built Solutions</p>
<p>providing end-to-end working samples</p>
<p>accelerators can be imported into your</p>
<p>environment as a starting point</p>
<p>from which you then can extend from</p>
<p>and patents are pre-configured data</p>
<p>streams at servers building blocks that</p>
<p>you can compose and extend out</p>
<p>you'll also be able to create your own</p>
<p>versions and collaborate internally and</p>
<p>externally</p>
<p>so we currently have a library</p>
<p>predefined Solutions in our XM Pro</p>
<p>GitHub project which you can now check</p>
<p>out</p>
<p>we'll also continue to add to these over</p>
<p>time and next we're looking at adding a</p>
<p>library UI into our accent pro products</p>
<p>to access and integrate them a little</p>
<p>bit more easier</p>
<p>we've completed a perfect concept of</p>
<p>meta blocks and are planning on studying</p>
<p>development soon and we've selected</p>
<p>several new and existing blocks to be</p>
<p>candidates for that first release</p>
<p>we're currently using several providers</p>
<p>for my common storage layer internally</p>
<p>for collaboration and we'll be exposing</p>
<p>these publicly</p>
<p>we're beginning planning We Begin</p>
<p>planning on how we'll integrate these</p>
<p>products in the UI shortly</p>
<p>where process and Technology meet we</p>
<p>need strong governance to be secure</p>
<p>across deployments and we do this with</p>
<p>zero trust architecture</p>
<p>zero trust architecture is not new for</p>
<p>us at X and pro and something we take</p>
<p>really seriously</p>
<p>we aim to give you more control over</p>
<p>what users can access with finer grained</p>
<p>Access Control</p>
<p>the product rights will align closer to</p>
<p>API endpoint functionality and not UI</p>
<p>components we'll still have product</p>
<p>roles to manage any additional</p>
<p>complexity this might introduce and in</p>
<p>this diagram you can see a user</p>
<p>accessing data via connector or</p>
<p>recommendations functionality previously</p>
<p>these would have been these five rights</p>
<p>here would have been three different</p>
<p>rights this change allows for greater</p>
<p>control over what users can access</p>
<p>and by aligning these rights to API</p>
<p>endpoints it makes it simpler to apply</p>
<p>the principle of least privilege at</p>
<p>scale</p>
<p>we currently run several security scans</p>
<p>every three months months and uh and</p>
<p>publish these results to our website</p>
<p>in addition to this we'll be running</p>
<p>incremental scans on every code change</p>
<p>for each product to pick up potential</p>
<p>vulnerabilities earlier this change will</p>
<p>ensure that any new vulnerabilities are</p>
<p>identified and addressed as soon as</p>
<p>possible</p>
<p>so XM Pro currently supports integration</p>
<p>to Azure ad ID provider providing an</p>
<p>easy way to leverage existing user</p>
<p>logins and security policies and</p>
<p>features like SSO and MFA</p>
<p>we're extending this functionality to</p>
<p>include support for more scenarios like</p>
<p>a Federated tenancy model</p>
<p>this integration has been done using</p>
<p>industry standards making it easier for</p>
<p>us to add new providers when it's</p>
<p>necessary</p>
<p>as we implement the edge to Cloud</p>
<p>Continuum and monitoring and managing</p>
<p>product performance is critical</p>
<p>we need it we're implementing support</p>
<p>for application Performance Management</p>
<p>tooling and we're doing this using</p>
<p>industry standards so adding new</p>
<p>providers will be easier using this</p>
<p>integration you'll be able to monitor</p>
<p>performance of our products</p>
<p>be alerted when there's issues and if</p>
<p>needed do basic troubleshooting yourself</p>
<p>so we're applying finer grade access</p>
<p>controls incrementally to each of our</p>
<p>products with the first product in</p>
<p>development now</p>
<p>we have continuous security scanning set</p>
<p>up on most of our products are in the</p>
<p>process of updating the remaining right</p>
<p>now</p>
<p>and we currently have support for Azure</p>
<p>ID and like I mentioned before we're</p>
<p>just extending this to support more</p>
<p>scenarios like a Federated tenancy model</p>
<p>and we're currently adding support for</p>
<p>Azure app insights as a APN provider</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>we'll be running webinars on the items</p>
<p>shown today as they become available and</p>
<p>diving into a lot more deeper detail</p>
<p>if you have any questions please send</p>
<p>them through and I'll try to answer them</p>
<p>now thanks</p>
<p>thanks Dan um so we've got two questions</p>
<p>here already</p>
<p>um the first one is where can we find</p>
<p>more information on XM Pro AI</p>
<p>okay great question ah thanks Sarah</p>
<p>so that segues really nicely uh next</p>
<p>month Gavin Green will be doing a</p>
<p>webinar on AI and he'll go into a lot</p>
<p>more detail</p>
<p>um I'd encourage you to sign up for that</p>
<p>and attend</p>
<p>um we're very close to releasing X and</p>
<p>pro notebooks in our free trial soon</p>
<p>um I think it's a couple of days away at</p>
<p>the stage just keep an eye out for that</p>
<p>uh sign up have a play around with our</p>
<p>free trial and the different AR</p>
<p>capabilities that are in there and I</p>
<p>also believe we're publishing a web page</p>
<p>specifically around Ai and our website</p>
<p>and the features that you can leverage</p>
<p>there so keep an eye out for that as</p>
<p>well</p>
<p>awesome there's another question here um</p>
<p>it says with Edge to Cloud continuum</p>
<p>providing any</p>
<p>s around containerized architecture</p>
<p>good question uh yes really really</p>
<p>excited about this one</p>
<p>um so actually we currently have Docker</p>
<p>images for our stream hosts these are</p>
<p>the engines that run our data streams</p>
<p>we're adding Docker images for other</p>
<p>products and we'll be creating a</p>
<p>container registry that will be</p>
<p>publishing these two</p>
<p>um we will likely do webinars on this as</p>
<p>this becomes available</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so yes</p>
<p>awesome and then one very important</p>
<p>question asking will we receive a copy</p>
<p>of the webinar from today</p>
<p>yes yeah this is probably where I do the</p>
<p>uh like And subscribe Us on YouTube</p>
<p>um yes we'll be putting this on YouTube</p>
<p>on our XM Pro Channel all of our</p>
<p>webinars are on there including uh Peter</p>
<p>Scott fakes previous one I mentioned</p>
<p>please jump on there and look at it look</p>
<p>at it um Sarah do you know how long</p>
<p>it'll take for it to get up there</p>

<p>thanks</p>
<p>that's it for the questions</p>
<p>oh I head over to you oh thanks</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>um so if you just want to change science</p>
<p>then</p>
<p>cool</p>
<p>thanks everyone um so thanks very much</p>
<p>Dan for taking us through and thanks</p>
<p>everyone for joining us if you're</p>

<p>contact Dan directly or the team via</p>
<p>these email addresses as Dan mentions</p>
<p>we're running these webinars monthly and</p>
<p>our next session will be on XM Pro AI</p>
<p>presented by Gavin Green so you can</p>
<p>register by scanning the QR code there's</p>
<p>a link in the chat box and I'll also be</p>
<p>sending the link</p>
