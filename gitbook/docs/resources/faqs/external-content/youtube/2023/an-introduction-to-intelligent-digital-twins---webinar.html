<details>
<summary>Transcript</summary>hi everybody I'm Peter from Skull click
<p>um the CEO of Ericsson Pro and the topic</p>
<p>for today is intelligent digital twins</p>
<p>um I wish I I could take the credit for</p>
<p>coming up with the concept of</p>
<p>intelligent digital twins but we're</p>
<p>really standing on the shoulders of</p>
<p>giants um Dr Michael Greaves who</p>
<p>is also known as the father of digital</p>
<p>twins actually started the concept or in</p>
<p>his work looking at where digital twins</p>
<p>are going</p>
<p>came up with it</p>
<p>concept of industrial of intelligent</p>
<p>digital Twins and you can also find</p>
<p>um a great paper that he where he</p>
<p>explains the whole concept</p>
<p>um at the digital</p>
<p>twin1.org and we'll also make the the um</p>
<p>the link available after the webinar and</p>
<p>I I was fortunate I had the opportunity</p>
<p>to meet with Dr Griggs at one of the</p>
<p>digital twin Consulting member meetings</p>
<p>and we discussed where things are going</p>
<p>with digital Twins and this is a diagram</p>
<p>that he's got in in the piper</p>
<p>um and he explains kind of the evolution</p>
<p>and right now we're seeing quite a lot</p>
<p>of ad hoc so sometimes people refer to</p>
<p>this as digital Shadows where there's</p>
<p>one-way communication so we've got the</p>
<p>physical</p>
<p>items and that updates a a digital</p>
<p>version so I'm creating a static</p>
<p>repository of data and we've seen more</p>
<p>and more digital twin platforms emerging</p>
<p>where there's some replication of data</p>
<p>going around</p>
<p>and and the future is moving towards uh</p>
<p>intelligent digital twins with things</p>
<p>like front running simulations and</p>
<p>everything so</p>
<p>really expensive paper that explains it</p>
<p>all my summary of the paper</p>
<p>um quickly ran through that is we're</p>
<p>moving from a focus on data to focus on</p>
<p>data flow so the difference between a</p>
<p>traditional digital twin where it's just</p>
<p>a passive repository and we kind of</p>
<p>taking data from my physical and just</p>
<p>representing it in in a virtual way to</p>
<p>something which is active and always on</p>
<p>so it continuously monitors the</p>
<p>environment and the the assets itself</p>
<p>where the traditional digital twin is</p>
<p>more of an offline and it writes for the</p>
<p>physical to actuate it so even if you</p>
<p>think of something like airbags there's</p>
<p>a a</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>it's as soon as an event happens on the</p>
<p>physical it updates the digital on the</p>
<p>online one this this continues running</p>
<p>on the side and it monitors scans the</p>
<p>environment and based on that also</p>
<p>creates actuation of of potential</p>
<p>actions that come out of it</p>
<p>with traditional digital twins we give</p>
<p>it a a goal and then we create kpis and</p>
<p>performance measures to see how well</p>
<p>we're doing based on the goals that we</p>
<p>are with that we've set for that</p>
<p>with intelligent digital twins we can</p>
<p>now use more intelligent approaches to</p>
<p>make it more goal-seeking to try and</p>
<p>optimize where we augment what humans</p>
<p>are doing with AI</p>
<p>and smarter digital twins to to support</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>and lastly we have predictive</p>
<p>capabilities so we can predict but it's</p>
<p>not really optimizing so it's not</p>
<p>looking for certain optimal set points</p>
<p>operating points</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>maintenance intervals those kind of</p>
<p>things where going forward doing things</p>
<p>like front running</p>
<p>simulation we are able to speed up and</p>
<p>that's what we mean by manipulate time</p>
<p>we can take real-time data we can take</p>
<p>contextual data we can take historical</p>
<p>data and speed that all up and then</p>
<p>based on that anticipate what is going</p>
<p>to happen and see what are the better</p>
<p>responses for those and great example of</p>
<p>front running simulation is what happens</p>
<p>in Formula One car Rising</p>
<p>and example is a partner with Dell it's</p>
<p>this is not built on XM Pro but this is</p>
<p>work that Dell has done with McLaren</p>
<p>around things like front running</p>
<p>simulation so this is one of the fastest</p>
<p>Edge devices out there</p>
<p>um it goes uh 200 miles an hour or 360</p>
<p>km 360 uh</p>
<p>kilometers per hour</p>
<p>and at that it generates about a hundred</p>
<p>thousand data points per second so a lot</p>
<p>of information that you can put together</p>
<p>and based on that determine fuel</p>
<p>strategies and a whole bunch of other</p>
<p>things during race time so ability to</p>
<p>speed up so take the data run it faster</p>
<p>than real time to speed it up and then</p>
<p>decide and</p>
<p>um on on on certain actions so this is</p>
<p>the McLaren example and this also</p>
<p>great work done by Amazon AWS and others</p>
<p>on on on on similar things so things</p>
<p>like again tracking information on the</p>
<p>vehicles they can track information</p>
<p>combining all of that you can create</p>
<p>multiple use cases and I think that's</p>
<p>one of the the other elements of digital</p>
<p>twins that's that's quite uh that's not</p>
<p>often understood it's not about one</p>
<p>application or use case that I'm trying</p>
<p>to do I can now take that data and I can</p>
<p>actually facilitate a multiple number of</p>
<p>different things that I can do so</p>
<p>multiple use cases in this instance of</p>
<p>battle Focus pitch strategy Striker</p>
<p>Performance Tire performance exit speeds</p>
<p>a whole bunch of different front running</p>
<p>simulations that I can do in a specific</p>
<p>interesting one is undercut thread so</p>
<p>um great video on the AWS website as</p>
<p>well</p>
<p>um but with undercut thread it's</p>
<p>actually deciding when to bring your car</p>
<p>in and also looking at what are your</p>
<p>competitors potentially doing so are</p>
<p>they looking at undercutting you by</p>
<p>bringing in a vehicle by bringing in a</p>
<p>race car at a certain window of</p>
<p>opportunity now in order to do that you</p>
<p>need to meet you need to measure the</p>
<p>real-time speed of all your other</p>
<p>competitors look at their way by using</p>
<p>computer vision and a whole bunch of</p>
<p>things die away</p>
<p>um trying to figure out what their fuel</p>
<p>consumption is take all of that and run</p>
<p>it in your strategy so these are very</p>
<p>sophisticated and advanced examples of</p>
<p>front running simulation but we're</p>
<p>starting to see that move into the</p>
<p>industrial space and other areas where</p>
<p>we are trying to do this so</p>
<p>from a digital twin perspective how we</p>
<p>make decisions is changing as you saw in</p>
<p>those very sophisticated examples we can</p>
<p>bring a whole lot of information from</p>
<p>multiple different places</p>
<p>and that's really the essence of</p>
<p>decision intelligence</p>
<p>where we've got external information</p>
<p>we've got internal information and</p>
<p>traditionally what we've done with kind</p>
<p>of the more static digital Twins or or</p>
<p>conventional digital twins is really</p>
<p>decision support</p>
<p>so there's a business process there's a</p>
<p>human in that Loop and we are now</p>
<p>um trying to give them some decision</p>
<p>support and traditionally it's been</p>
<p>dashboards and business intelligence</p>
<p>condition monitoring basic predictions</p>
<p>as well</p>
<p>um so again the mind of of decision</p>
<p>support we're seeing more and more</p>
<p>decision augmentation where we can bring</p>
<p>in smarts from Ai and other tools</p>
<p>so um we still have the human in the</p>
<p>loop that make the decision but that</p>
<p>human is now the the decision process is</p>
<p>augmented with</p>
<p>um information that can be processed at</p>
<p>a speed that humans can't do it the</p>
<p>volume of information that that can be</p>
<p>processed again is done at a speed that</p>
<p>we can't do as as humans but</p>
<p>at the end the decision Still Remains</p>
<p>with us so this is where front running</p>
<p>simulations prescriptive recommendations</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>is is coming in and this provides us the</p>
<p>opportunity to create a closed loop a</p>
<p>feedback loop and learn from that and</p>
<p>kind of improve our decision making as</p>
<p>well as improve the models that we have</p>
<p>and this is kind of where a lot of um</p>
<p>focus is at the moment in terms of</p>
<p>moving towards more intelligent digital</p>
<p>twins</p>
<p>but there is a future where we also look</p>
<p>at decision automation so once we have a</p>
<p>high level of confidence on in some of</p>
<p>these decisions or or some of these</p>
<p>models we can actually let the machine</p>
<p>make the decision through business</p>
<p>process Automation and create this</p>
<p>distributed intelligence system</p>
<p>where we can maintain the rules and the</p>
<p>models and everything centrally and it</p>
<p>it it it provides us the opportunity to</p>
<p>get to algorithmic business where again</p>
<p>a certain number of these of of these</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>business processes that can be done in</p>
<p>an automated advice so if you think</p>
<p>about fly by wire which you can do with</p>
<p>aircraft</p>
<p>you might be able to operate by wire in</p>
<p>a certain envelope those decisions can</p>
<p>all be made by machines so that's</p>
<p>the future that we see in terms of where</p>
<p>this is all heading distributed</p>
<p>intelligence systems and now if you</p>
<p>combine that with the control</p>
<p>environments if you look at a</p>
<p>distributed control systems and you add</p>
<p>distributed intelligence systems my</p>
<p>personal views that's probably the</p>
<p>future of what operations will look like</p>
<p>now what does this mean for intelligent</p>
<p>digital Twins and I refer back to the</p>
<p>digital twin Consortium</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>definition of what a digital twin is</p>
<p>it's a virtual representation of</p>
<p>entities uh of real world entities and</p>
<p>processes to synchronized at a certain</p>
<p>frequency frequency and fidelity</p>
<p>interested in being on it's synchronized</p>
<p>and it helps us with decision making and</p>
<p>taking effective action again it's about</p>
<p>decision making it uses all sorts of</p>
<p>data and it is motivated by outcomes and</p>
<p>it's focused around use cases again that</p>
<p>example that I showed with the front</p>
<p>running simulation a whole bunch of</p>
<p>different</p>
<p>use cases</p>
<p>um that are being facilitated for that</p>
<p>and we implement it in it requires the</p>
<p>main knowledge and implemented through</p>
<p>this so</p>
<p>at a traditional digital twin has got</p>
<p>um that synchronization Sometimes some</p>
<p>of the information may go back</p>
<p>but it's really passive it's offline</p>
<p>um in the sense that it's waiting for</p>
<p>the thing on the on the left hand side</p>
<p>the physical twin something to happen</p>
<p>and that will then update that's not um</p>
<p>and it's called Givens I've got kpis and</p>
<p>things that I'm trying to to measure and</p>
<p>yeah we can predict but it's not focused</p>
<p>on optimization</p>
<p>going forward with intelligent digital</p>
<p>twins we see that decision intelligence</p>
<p>structure that I showed a little bit</p>
<p>earlier make its way into kind of</p>
<p>operating on the side so</p>
<p>we've got expert knowledge business</p>
<p>rules all the math and physics models</p>
<p>that we have and quite a few of those</p>
<p>are already being used in the uh more</p>
<p>decision support type digital twins that</p>
<p>we have we're now starting to see convey</p>
<p>what is regarded as conventional AI so</p>
<p>regression models and all of those but</p>
<p>then also the new generative AI that</p>
<p>we've seen lightly and large language</p>
<p>models that are making its way in</p>
<p>and some of the more sophisticated</p>
<p>techniques like deep learning neural</p>
<p>networks and those so that in</p>
<p>intelligence making is it's why</p>
<p>into digital Twins and then providing</p>
<p>the opportunity to Market goal seeking</p>
<p>and learning and doing this front</p>
<p>running simulations now the question</p>
<p>that we get is how do how do we make</p>
<p>this happen how do we do this because in</p>
<p>order in order to do this we need this</p>
<p>thing that intelligence that run on the</p>
<p>side almost and we go from where in the</p>
<p>previous one we had information at the</p>
<p>bottom there we now have prescriptions</p>
<p>and that is synchronized at a different</p>
<p>rate so it's not just the information</p>
<p>we've seen in back we actually send a</p>
<p>prescription in terms of what to do</p>
<p>um back now this could be augmented or</p>
<p>potentially automated as well but we</p>
<p>have to have this mechanism on the side</p>
<p>that continuously runs so now going from</p>
<p>data this requires a data flow where it</p>
<p>continuously run on the site and</p>
<p>interact with that</p>
<p>so in order to do this we came up with a</p>
<p>framework</p>
<p>as organizations are considering how do</p>
<p>we move to intelligent digital twins</p>
<p>well first of all it needs to be</p>
<p>integrated and it needs to be based on</p>
<p>standards models and have that</p>
<p>bi-directional integration that we that</p>
<p>I mentioned it needs to have</p>
<p>intelligence and we'll go into each of</p>
<p>these in a little bit more detail but</p>
<p>needs to be executable so it needs to be</p>
<p>able to run in real time we need some</p>
<p>way to make it Innovative and explore</p>
<p>experimentation and doing those</p>
<p>simulations but we also need to provide</p>
<p>an environment where we can bring in</p>
<p>the the the help from from the digital</p>
<p>Twin Side and augment so that we can</p>
<p>learn from that</p>
<p>and lastly we need to migrate</p>
<p>interactive so</p>
<p>um this is about the visualization so</p>
<p>how do we how do we provide</p>
<p>recommendations how do we make it in a</p>
<p>generative multi-experience user</p>
<p>interface</p>
<p>because all of this is becoming the</p>
<p>foundation for the industrial metaverse</p>
<p>whatever the metaverse looks like when</p>
<p>it comes out in order to do this at</p>
<p>scale we also need to do this on the</p>
<p>composable kind of</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>framework where we can reuse components</p>
<p>almost like the Lego blocks that kids</p>
<p>build</p>
<p>um toys with you can actually reuse</p>
<p>components and and and have a plugable</p>
<p>composable uh price for this</p>
<p>so if we briefly look at the integrated</p>
<p>side of things</p>
<p>um standards-based apis for these</p>
<p>capabilities that we package together a</p>
<p>model driven approach and bi-directional</p>
<p>in order to do this again this is about</p>
<p>data flow so example that we're showing</p>
<p>here this is our data stream designer is</p>
<p>being able to create standard</p>
<p>Integrations</p>
<p>to the apis of different systems then</p>
<p>being able to create a model now the</p>
<p>benefit of this is I can apply this to</p>
<p>um uh 100 wind turbines or a thousand</p>
<p>when turbines is exactly the same model</p>
<p>so in terms of the data model that</p>
<p>supports it and potentially the digital</p>
<p>twin model also model driven but in</p>
<p>terms of of creating The Logical data</p>
<p>flow structure making that model driven</p>
<p>and at the bottom right</p>
<p>it's not just about in uh have receiving</p>
<p>information one way but also sending</p>
<p>information back and potentially</p>
<p>changing set points um based on</p>
<p>recommendations that could come from Ai</p>
<p>and some of the other elements</p>
<p>so that's the the from integration</p>
<p>perspective making it more intelligent</p>
<p>where we now adding this capability</p>
<p>first of all in terms of those three</p>
<p>elements we need to make it executable</p>
<p>we need to provide an environment to to</p>
<p>to to for um to create these AI elements</p>
<p>and then we need to augment the user</p>
<p>experience with that and again different</p>
<p>audiences which this applies to so if I</p>
<p>look at that executable how do I bring</p>
<p>it into the data flow traditionally we</p>
<p>would take real-time data we would have</p>
<p>a model and</p>
<p>um so we've got the streaming agent that</p>
<p>with that with um</p>
<p>bring in real-time data we've got a</p>
<p>configuration of what the fly looks like</p>
<p>and that just gives us a result</p>
<p>with executable AI</p>
<p>um we can create a training model and</p>
<p>I'll briefly Show an example we'll</p>
<p>create a training model I'm using the in</p>
<p>this instance our XM Pro AI notebook</p>
<p>deploy that model into into an ml Ops</p>
<p>environment because again we need to now</p>
<p>look at how do we do this at scale if</p>
<p>I've got tens of thousands of models how</p>
<p>do I do the model management and as part</p>
<p>of the digital twin management as well</p>
<p>and then bring that in through bring</p>
<p>that model in through again an agent</p>
<p>that's got the intelligence bringing</p>
<p>live data on that can now run on that</p>
<p>training model and again in our in our</p>
<p>now code in environment you can</p>
<p>configure all of this and that will give</p>
<p>you the prediction and simulation</p>
<p>so what does it look like when you</p>
<p>actually do it</p>
<p>um what you can see here is a very basic</p>
<p>Way Reading uh tanks type and you'll see</p>
<p>where the yellow perform machine</p>
<p>learning analysis that actually calls a</p>
<p>beer quality model that sits in uh</p>
<p>uh the through um ml flow where where</p>
<p>which is the data repository for the</p>
<p>model so that's how we make the digital</p>
<p>twins</p>
<p>executable in the data streams that we</p>
<p>have the next part is</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>to be able to bring in an environment</p>
<p>where we can make it more Innovative so</p>
<p>we've embedded jupyter notebooks but</p>
<p>we've added some functionality to that</p>
<p>so you can wire it up into our data</p>
<p>streams but you can also integrate it</p>
<p>with things like giant GPT and others to</p>
<p>help you in the process</p>
<p>so again aimed at</p>
<p>on the one hand in analyzing the data</p>
<p>but also building models</p>
<p>um for things like front running</p>
<p>simulations and some of the others in</p>
<p>this instance I've got chat GPT</p>
<p>and um I I can ask it to tags to create</p>
<p>a code for me which is the next part</p>
<p>over here to create the guide for me to</p>
<p>represent this data</p>
<p>in this in a certain way so having the</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>um the request</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>having a request here through GPT</p>
<p>how do I visualize this data it then</p>
<p>writes the python code for me and it I</p>
<p>hope if I run that and it gives me the</p>
<p>visualization here's another example of</p>
<p>of embedding</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>or augmenting</p>
<p>um the the user experience in this</p>
<p>instance there's a copilot so we ran</p>
<p>this and based on the recommendations at</p>
<p>the top we can see that there is</p>
<p>potentially a impeller problem but I can</p>
<p>also see my discharge pressure is not</p>
<p>what it should be</p>
<p>so I can ask you know what are the top</p>
<p>five root causes for centrifugal pump if</p>
<p>there's a loss in discharge pressure and</p>
<p>you can see what it came up with if we</p>
<p>have time on briefly jump into and</p>
<p>showing you what that</p>
<p>is um towards the international fact let</p>
<p>me briefly let me quickly do that</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>this is the Jupiter notebook with the</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>foreign</p>
<p>I can run through this it will generate</p>
<p>data for me</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>this is</p>
<p>machine generated data and now I ask</p>
<p>Chad GPT</p>
<p>to actually create the um</p>
<p>let me move down a little bit so I'm now</p>
<p>going to ask Jack GPT to create the code</p>
<p>for me</p>
<p>to visualize this data</p>
<p>and that's done that and now it's</p>
<p>created based on the code that it's</p>
<p>created for me in Python automatically</p>
<p>and also created the visualization</p>
<p>um and again this goes into more</p>
<p>actually putting this into into an email</p>
<p>slope on the the other example that I</p>
<p>briefly mentioned so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>on the well Refinery operations</p>
<p>and I just go to that pump</p>
<p>we just got an issue</p>
<p>and you can see the normal information</p>
<p>that I have I've got all the contextual</p>
<p>information but I also want to ask it a</p>
<p>question now</p>
<p>um I'll just one of the top five root</p>
<p>causes and this thing interrogates using</p>
<p>um functionality of chat GPT to do that</p>
<p>so that's ways that we can bring</p>
<p>intelligence to it lastly on the</p>
<p>interactive side</p>
<p>to make it more accessible</p>
<p>in terms of providing recommendations</p>
<p>again uh</p>
<p>the intelligent digital twins have have</p>
<p>the opportunity to not just</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>tell you what is wrong but also give a</p>
<p>recommendation on on what you should be</p>
<p>doing triage instructions and some</p>
<p>additional context around what happened</p>
<p>in the past this gives you the</p>
<p>opportunity to also close the loop I can</p>
<p>create work orders and and things from</p>
<p>here and then be able to track that as</p>
<p>well to see how effective we are at</p>
<p>making certain decisions in terms of</p>
<p>creating a collaborative environment as</p>
<p>you can type as the previous example</p>
<p>which I briefly showed you</p>
<p>you can create very collaborative</p>
<p>environments and user experiences where</p>
<p>you now bring that intelligence</p>
<p>um into a front end that that users and</p>
<p>can use</p>
<p>and as I mentioned going forward you</p>
<p>know this will form the foundation of</p>
<p>the industrial nativist now the Brew the</p>
<p>Brewing example that you see here is is</p>
<p>actually an example that we built out</p>
<p>for the Dow validated</p>
<p>solution for the manufacturing Edge side</p>
<p>of things but this is what we see going</p>
<p>forward in terms of creating a meta</p>
<p>versus in a very interactive environment</p>
<p>where you know it doesn't matter what</p>
<p>your user experience is whether it's AR</p>
<p>VR desktops mobiles</p>
<p>um the intelligence is portable across</p>
<p>all of those</p>
<p>environments lastly and</p>
<p>the composable side</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>we came up with the the</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>positioning XM Pros that can composable</p>
<p>platform and</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>bringing in data from all the the the</p>
<p>underlying systems to be able to build</p>
<p>authorize various different use cases</p>
<p>and for that we have a whole bunch of</p>
<p>of</p>
<p>um modules that that support that so</p>
<p>in order to do that the basis for all of</p>
<p>that is is</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>capabilities and inside digital</p>
<p>Consortium we were instrumental in</p>
<p>creating the the</p>
<p>um capabilities periodic table these are</p>
<p>all capabilities that we see at a really</p>
<p>high level and that is used for digital</p>
<p>twins if you're wanting more information</p>
<p>on the digital Consortium website you</p>
<p>can download</p>
<p>the the whole</p>
<p>capabilities framework we also have a</p>
<p>webinar that we've done in the past</p>
<p>which you can have a look at where we go</p>
<p>into the capabilities and composability</p>
<p>and side for that so so here's our view</p>
<p>in terms of what the future looks like</p>
<p>oh sorry oh so the the the the</p>
<p>components that you need in order to</p>
<p>create intelligent digital twins which</p>
<p>we see as the future of where digital</p>
<p>twins are going we've created we've run</p>
<p>all that all into what we call</p>
<p>intelligent digital twin Suite example</p>
<p>idps consists of a number of modules and</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>happy to share more information on that</p>
<p>just lastly we also see that this way in</p>
<p>terms of where we are going and how</p>
<p>we're doing this at that line in future</p>
<p>may disappear and that intelligence all</p>
<p>being built into the</p>
<p>um digital twins of the future so with</p>
<p>that um there's a few minutes left any</p>
<p>questions that that everyone's got that</p>
<p>I can address</p>
<p>great presentation you do have a few</p>
<p>questions that came out there</p>
<p>um take it from the top uh do you one of</p>
<p>the questions that I that that we get is</p>
<p>you know do you supply the AI models</p>
<p>it's</p>
<p>it is the reason why we created that</p>
<p>environment so inside</p>
<p>um the XM Pro AI notebook</p>
<p>um you can create your own models there</p>
<p>are libraries of existing models</p>
<p>um there are Auto ml there's a whole</p>
<p>um uh kind of Continuum of opportunity</p>
<p>to use pre-made libraries of of models</p>
<p>we don't specifically do do models but</p>
<p>um there's a large library of of</p>
<p>simulation models of</p>
<p>all the standard</p>
<p>um traditional IR models as well as as</p>
<p>you saw being able to bring in</p>
<p>generative Ai and others pretty easily</p>
<p>how do you get started with this</p>
<p>um we're happy to run you through kind</p>
<p>of the the kind of three-step process</p>
<p>um on on how to get started with these</p>
<p>digital twins but hopefully that's been</p>
<p>been helpful in giving you an</p>
<p>understanding of you know what we see as</p>
<p>the future and what digital twin what</p>
<p>what intelligent digital twins</p>
<p>look like going forward</p>
<p>any additional questions</p>
<p>I have one question that was sent to me</p>
<p>around</p>
<p>um so yeah again this is I think the the</p>
<p>the way that we</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>that we look at how to how to create</p>
<p>this look at it it needs to be</p>
<p>integrated that needs to be intelligent</p>
<p>needs to be interactive all on a</p>
<p>composable approach and then in terms of</p>
<p>um the question is really do are they</p>
<p>starters or examples we have a</p>
<p>blueprints that we are creating they are</p>
<p>they are started</p>
<p>examples available in GitHub so we're</p>
<p>really easy to export into your</p>
<p>environment</p>
<p>um and then play with that we do have a</p>
<p>freemium option so if you go on a</p>
<p>website you can download premium option</p>
<p>um of us of our software and also some</p>
<p>of these libraries and examples that we</p>
<p>have</p>
<p>over that um thank you very much I</p>
<p>really appreciate you watching this and</p>
<p>we'll see you uh on the future webinar</p>
<p>we will send out the recording of this</p>
<p>um after the event thank you</p>
