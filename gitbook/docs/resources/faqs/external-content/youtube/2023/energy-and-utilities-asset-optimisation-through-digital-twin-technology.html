<summary>Transcript</summary>I'm beautiful and I will run you through
<p>how energy and utilities do asset</p>
<p>optimization using digital twin</p>
<p>technology</p>
<p>when we speak to Executives in energy</p>
<p>and utilities and specifically around</p>
<p>asset optimization using digital twins</p>
<p>we kind of hear the same three questions</p>
<p>what is a digital twin why should I care</p>
<p>and how do I get started</p>
<p>so I'll start with what is a digital</p>
<p>twin we were early member of the digital</p>
<p>twin Consortium and in that Consortium</p>
<p>of 250 organizations came up with a</p>
<p>definition of a digital twin is a</p>
<p>virtual representation of a real world</p>
<p>entity or process that is synchronized</p>
<p>at a specific frequency and Fidelity and</p>
<p>the key is that it synchronizes the</p>
<p>visual representation of an entity which</p>
<p>could be a physical entity or something</p>
<p>like a business process</p>
<p>It Is underpinned by three things which</p>
<p>is it needs to improve understanding</p>
<p>decision making and effective action it</p>
<p>needs to use real-time historical and</p>
<p>historical data to help you analyze what</p>
<p>happened in the past what's happening</p>
<p>right now and what's likely to happen in</p>
<p>the future</p>
<p>now digital twins should be driven from</p>
<p>a business perspective around outcomes</p>
<p>we grade them around specific use cases</p>
<p>or applications</p>
<p>they are powered by integration a key</p>
<p>aspect using data and guided by</p>
<p>Specialists to understand the domain</p>
<p>where they operate and typically these</p>
<p>are implemented in the in the industrial</p>
<p>environment like energy utilities</p>
<p>through ID and ID systems</p>
<p>if we explain this in a picture on the</p>
<p>left hand side we have the physical</p>
<p>entity or the physical twin</p>
<p>and on the right hand side we have the</p>
<p>digital twin which consists of a model</p>
<p>consists of data that is synchronized at</p>
<p>a certain twinning right</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>during that synchronization we create an</p>
<p>instance or instantiate the digital twin</p>
<p>based on the model I can have one model</p>
<p>and a thousand pumps in this example and</p>
<p>sometimes the digital twin would feed</p>
<p>information back</p>
<p>do the equipment but that is not</p>
<p>necessary from a digital twin definition</p>
<p>perspective but it does need</p>
<p>synchronization from the physical to the</p>
<p>virtual side of it so 50 000 foot view</p>
<p>of what it is now you also get very</p>
<p>simple discrete digital twins like a</p>
<p>Transformer not that it's a simple piece</p>
<p>of equipment but you can create it a</p>
<p>simple digital twin around that which</p>
<p>could be part of a composite digital</p>
<p>twin for example the substation and that</p>
<p>substation is part of a larger bigger</p>
<p>Network which then becomes a system of</p>
<p>systems Challenge and that's how the</p>
<p>scope and scale of digital Twins and the</p>
<p>interoperability challenge with it grows</p>
<p>what does life look like like right now</p>
<p>with our digital twins well operations</p>
<p>maintenance safety and all these other</p>
<p>functions have their own little systems</p>
<p>on the right hand side where they</p>
<p>sometimes duplicate data and have</p>
<p>different systems and each of them or do</p>
<p>have their own capabilities in different</p>
<p>silos what a digital twin brings it's</p>
<p>really that proxy that allows you to use</p>
<p>common capabilities in the middle and</p>
<p>then let the different areas of the</p>
<p>business create use cases we'll get back</p>
<p>to these six core capabilities as you</p>
<p>see them there when you talk a little</p>
<p>bit later on how to build these things</p>
<p>so just remember the paper clip will get</p>
<p>back to that</p>
<p>the second question that we get is why</p>
<p>should I K now again in energy and</p>
<p>utilities</p>
<p>some of the examples here is really</p>
<p>around the measurable Roi and this is</p>
<p>how microgreens talks about the</p>
<p>impediments of digital Twins and why you</p>
<p>know from an adoption perspective one of</p>
<p>them is that you have to have</p>
<p>value-based use cases because</p>
<p>accountants are the killers of Joy</p>
<p>according to him and if you didn't know</p>
<p>he was the founder of the term</p>
<p>uh digital twins looking at energy</p>
<p>utilities and specifically</p>
<p>on the asset side predictive maintenance</p>
<p>according to Kinsey McKinsey and study</p>
<p>that was done anywhere between 10 to 20</p>
<p>my reduction of Maintenance costs as</p>
<p>well as increase in asset availability</p>
<p>but in 10 to 20 if you put that in</p>
<p>context of your organization it's</p>
<p>massive likewise with performance asset</p>
<p>Performance Management how do we improve</p>
<p>the utilization and and the asset</p>
<p>productivity again you can see anywhere</p>
<p>to doing five percent now if we move</p>
<p>that into the grid operation side of</p>
<p>things</p>
<p>on the</p>
<p>transmission side again anywhere from 10</p>
<p>to 20 in reduction in Grid related</p>
<p>outage times</p>
<p>from Navigant research the if we can now</p>
<p>start integrating some of these other</p>
<p>new generation or alternative energy</p>
<p>sources and we can do that in a</p>
<p>structured way then again the impact</p>
<p>anyway from three to five percent in</p>
<p>terms of improvement of getting those</p>
<p>online and lastly does it Disaster</p>
<p>Recovery things like natural</p>
<p>disasters and those how do we recover</p>
<p>from that how do we recover quicker and</p>
<p>this is from the electric power</p>
<p>Institute some of the numbers that they</p>
<p>are there</p>
<p>there's also been a shift in power so</p>
<p>how we did it traditionally we had</p>
<p>generation units and then we had load</p>
<p>units and we just it was just a</p>
<p>continuous optimization problem</p>
<p>will be moving to now</p>
<p>we have generators that are also</p>
<p>consumers and it's a really much more of</p>
<p>a balancing act and we have to sense the</p>
<p>side and act in a different way it</p>
<p>requires collaboration orchestration and</p>
<p>a lot more con flexibility compared to</p>
<p>where we came from historically now in</p>
<p>order to do that and this is from</p>
<p>Gartner to move now where we right now</p>
<p>have a limited amount of Renewables as</p>
<p>that changes and how we also centralized</p>
<p>everything even from the decision</p>
<p>support and the applications that we use</p>
<p>very monolithic applications and and</p>
<p>structures that we had moving into</p>
<p>intelligent distributed organizations</p>
<p>recomposable decisions the way to do</p>
<p>that is by one adopting digital twins in</p>
<p>the context of the discussion today as</p>
<p>well as composable capabilities and how</p>
<p>we do that</p>
<p>now again this all needs</p>
<p>executive support and we need to</p>
<p>Drive the ROI and the levers that they</p>
<p>have is really around and where digital</p>
<p>twins can support the the the ROI on the</p>
<p>investment is to help</p>
<p>with these assets around to run more</p>
<p>often to produce more or or enhance the</p>
<p>output while it's operating or running</p>
<p>improve the integration of distributed</p>
<p>assets and also minimize the cost in the</p>
<p>process all in the framework of enhanced</p>
<p>safety and also improving ESG across</p>
<p>these four key drivers or key threads</p>
<p>around business performance the process</p>
<p>optimization ESG monitoring compliance</p>
<p>and also asset performance and this is a</p>
<p>strategic initiative set now in order to</p>
<p>drive that a lot of organizations are</p>
<p>creating different initiatives so</p>
<p>underneath of those different</p>
<p>initiatives to address that but the real</p>
<p>trick is in moving from a strategic to a</p>
<p>tactical and operational side and</p>
<p>thinking about what the decision support</p>
<p>and automation requirements are at each</p>
<p>level of the triangle to turn the</p>
<p>strategy into execution at both the</p>
<p>Tactical and operational levels</p>
<p>when we look at this from a digital twin</p>
<p>perspective a little bit more bioropical</p>
<p>you'll see on the left hand side we have</p>
<p>strategic tactical and operational so</p>
<p>right at the top from a strategic</p>
<p>perspective I want to see all those Roi</p>
<p>drivers and I potentially even want to</p>
<p>see it across different sites which may</p>
<p>also have a tactical implication but</p>
<p>then I go into the asset health and then</p>
<p>the process household operational Health</p>
<p>with the equipment and again at</p>
<p>operational tactical levels and this is</p>
<p>what the digital twin can help you do</p>
<p>and one of the key things is you can</p>
<p>create metrics at every level to see how</p>
<p>good you are at doing that</p>
<p>now a different perspective on this and</p>
<p>the role of a digital twin is to create</p>
<p>that common operating picture for</p>
<p>operational awareness and response and</p>
<p>the whole idea is to change from</p>
<p>reactive to more prescriptive operations</p>
<p>and many organizations now inbound</p>
<p>utilities and asset intensive complex</p>
<p>Industries have</p>
<p>all array of complex assets where</p>
<p>there's already scada systems PLC</p>
<p>sensors and everything in there a whole</p>
<p>bunch of different applications inside</p>
<p>the organization Erp GIS name them ML</p>
<p>and then we're trying to use people</p>
<p>processes and automation to respond to</p>
<p>events that happens in all of this</p>
<p>context</p>
<p>and there are signals going from from</p>
<p>the assets into these systems and</p>
<p>transactions in terms of what people</p>
<p>need to do and we have subject matter</p>
<p>experts that have a deep understanding</p>
<p>of these of these assets and how they</p>
<p>operate now what we are trying to do is</p>
<p>first of all connect to all of those</p>
<p>signals and data and create some event</p>
<p>intelligence and in Excel Pro we do that</p>
<p>through what we call our data streams so</p>
<p>it's a visual way of connecting and</p>
<p>handling the integration to all of these</p>
<p>complex things around a specific use</p>
<p>case or application that we are trying</p>
<p>to do so it's a visual way of connecting</p>
<p>the data so that we can create</p>
<p>visualization so looking at the same</p>
<p>data at all the different levels but</p>
<p>from a different perspective or</p>
<p>different lens operationally I see</p>
<p>information and this is what we refer to</p>
<p>as event intelligence we are now</p>
<p>connected to these real-time data</p>
<p>streams and it now feeds our common</p>
<p>operating picture with the the or from</p>
<p>from the same data sources but a</p>
<p>different lens in perspective at the</p>
<p>Strategic level at the planning or</p>
<p>tactical level what's my view for the</p>
<p>next two two weeks a month a quarter</p>
<p>versus what's happening right now at</p>
<p>operational level and what do I do need</p>
<p>to do right now and this gives us</p>
<p>operations intelligence so now we've now</p>
<p>moved from event intelligence to being</p>
<p>able to operate in a better white and</p>
<p>again adding some more capability to</p>
<p>this is being able to create</p>
<p>recommendations that you can consolidate</p>
<p>from all of these different places and</p>
<p>have a consistent way that you present</p>
<p>how people respond</p>
<p>to different</p>
<p>events that happen but using again a</p>
<p>similar structure whether that strategic</p>
<p>level tactical level or even bringing it</p>
<p>from the underlying systems that sits at</p>
<p>the bottom for us that's the Holy Grail</p>
<p>of a common operating pictures not just</p>
<p>seeing the picture but to know what to</p>
<p>do and have prescriptive recommendations</p>
<p>which allows your smartest people to</p>
<p>kind of pull those Roi levers so they</p>
<p>know how to now manipulate those levers</p>
<p>which will reduce the risk of you being</p>
<p>blindsided by key events that are likely</p>
<p>to happen or happening</p>
<p>and it also improves the accountability</p>
<p>and close the feedback loop that</p>
<p>provides visibility and opportunity for</p>
<p>Learning and this is a whole new</p>
<p>business process but if I look at</p>
<p>digital twins in terms of business</p>
<p>processes this is not new this is from</p>
<p>Gartner in terms of you know looking for</p>
<p>example at an asset a digital twin what</p>
<p>you are trying to do is the asset</p>
<p>Performance Management</p>
<p>um you know when something's wrong we</p>
<p>want to rise a ticket for maintenance we</p>
<p>want to make sure that we've got people</p>
<p>we want to know that we've got space we</p>
<p>want to schedule the maintenance effort</p>
<p>and also create tasks and worklets for</p>
<p>for technicians to go out and do that</p>
<p>and then at that stage we can take the</p>
<p>asset offline for maintenance so once we</p>
<p>find a</p>
<p>vibration data that gives us an alert it</p>
<p>goes to full circle so in a way that's a</p>
<p>similar description but this is just a</p>
<p>new this is just a business process with</p>
<p>a different way of actuating and</p>
<p>responding to it instead of human to</p>
<p>human workflies this is now initiated</p>
<p>through machines and iot and sensors the</p>
<p>still analysis process there's still a</p>
<p>work plan process and there's still the</p>
<p>execution of making sure that it's done</p>
<p>and the values that's in improving the</p>
<p>yield and in terms of the business</p>
<p>outcomes making it more profitable</p>
<p>from an excellent Pro point of view with</p>
<p>a common operating picture it's the same</p>
<p>you know it's about integrating all of</p>
<p>this heterogeneous data in a drag and</p>
<p>drop way and then being able to combine</p>
<p>um off-the-shelf analytics with some</p>
<p>maybe some more advanced analytics</p>
<p>developed by your own SM</p>
<p>es in-house</p>
<p>getting that into the systems so that</p>
<p>you can go and create work orders and</p>
<p>things like that in Erp and eam and some</p>
<p>of the other systems and then create a</p>
<p>an interactive user experience a lot and</p>
<p>as we're moving into AR VR and some of</p>
<p>the others how do we support that so we</p>
<p>can help that technician to do the best</p>
<p>best job and then verifying and checking</p>
<p>that the work has been done</p>
<p>so we can close the loop on this the</p>
<p>next question that we get is so this is</p>
<p>all well and great but how do I get</p>
<p>started</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>the way that we get started and again</p>
<p>this is just based on a concept of</p>
<p>composable architecture there are many</p>
<p>different pictures I personally like</p>
<p>this one of well Gardner where it talks</p>
<p>about all these package business</p>
<p>capabilities that sit at the center so</p>
<p>how can we create these reusable blocks</p>
<p>almost like Lego blocks how can I create</p>
<p>all of these blocks and then allow my</p>
<p>subject matter experts where all the</p>
<p>data and everything comes from all the</p>
<p>existing systems that we have to be able</p>
<p>to compose new applications and this</p>
<p>this composition platform can handle</p>
<p>integration orchestration where you</p>
<p>exported at the operation and the</p>
<p>governance as we go through and then we</p>
<p>just build these applications on top</p>
<p>we've taken that same approach and just</p>
<p>applied it to the different types of</p>
<p>data and information that we see in the</p>
<p>industrial and specifically power</p>
<p>utilities environments so physics-based</p>
<p>models analytics iot and temporal data</p>
<p>transactional data and visual models and</p>
<p>master data as part of this you can see</p>
<p>all the the different types of that</p>
<p>lives in there through that we can now</p>
<p>create package business capabilities so</p>
<p>we can have Leak Detection we can do</p>
<p>current monitoring you can do ask</p>
<p>reusable little blocks of capabilities</p>
<p>and compose that together</p>
<p>to be able to grow digital twins that's</p>
<p>where X and profit we see ourselves as a</p>
<p>digital twin composition platform that's</p>
<p>really good at handling the integration</p>
<p>composition orchestration</p>
<p>the development of all of this and the</p>
<p>management as well as the ux spot that's</p>
<p>sort of on top of it while all of this</p>
<p>is integrated into Legacy Business</p>
<p>Systems I.T systems iot systems and kind</p>
<p>of the modern data Fabrics that we see a</p>
<p>lot of organizations Implement right now</p>
<p>that enables us to build</p>
<p>digital twins for Performance Management</p>
<p>fault detection automation</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>emissions and different we can reuse a</p>
<p>lot of the things that we've done and</p>
<p>the connections and and capabilities</p>
<p>have been packaged together in order to</p>
<p>do that from X and pro perspective the</p>
<p>way that we that we do that on the left</p>
<p>hand side we've got our data streams</p>
<p>which is the how do we connect and</p>
<p>integrate and compose and orchestrate on</p>
<p>the right hand side is more the ux and</p>
<p>the ux development in our application</p>
<p>designer so I mentioned earlier in terms</p>
<p>of the little paper clip and those six</p>
<p>capabilities that we saw inside digital</p>
<p>twin Consortium I had the opportunity to</p>
<p>lead a group that created the</p>
<p>capabilities of a periodic table and we</p>
<p>categorized all the capabilities of a</p>
<p>digital 20 into six main groups naming</p>
<p>uh data services integration</p>
<p>intelligence user experience management</p>
<p>and trustworthiness as the key</p>
<p>categories for these and inside that for</p>
<p>example with data services we have data</p>
<p>streaming data transformation so a whole</p>
<p>bunch of of core capabilities there's</p>
<p>actually 62 so in integration on</p>
<p>Intelligence on ux on how to manage all</p>
<p>of this and also from a trustworthiness</p>
<p>this is available on the digital twin</p>
<p>Consortium website</p>
<p>um so I'm not going to draw down into</p>
<p>much more detail you can get some</p>
<p>information there but there but you can</p>
<p>compose any digital twin by using some</p>
<p>of these blocks</p>
<p>and it gives so here's an example of</p>
<p>condition monitoring for a wind form in</p>
<p>this one I only use these capabilities</p>
<p>and if I want to create energy</p>
<p>prediction then suddenly I have machine</p>
<p>learning artificial intelligence and</p>
<p>some of the other things I need to add</p>
<p>which also helps us to start a</p>
<p>conversation around what capabilities do</p>
<p>we have in organization and which of</p>
<p>them should we look at building</p>
<p>partnering acquiring so there's a whole</p>
<p>bunch of things but it also helps us to</p>
<p>also not just focus on the smart</p>
<p>technical things because this is not a</p>
<p>technology or this is not an</p>
<p>architecture this is just core</p>
<p>capabilities but some of it relates to</p>
<p>trustworthiness like security safety</p>
<p>and also how do we handle things like</p>
<p>event logging and some of managing these</p>
<p>things at scale</p>
<p>so what does it look like as a typical</p>
<p>example so here is that wind form and</p>
<p>this is a remote Operation Center</p>
<p>so I can see my overall portfolio of</p>
<p>Wind forms and Silo forms and all sorts</p>
<p>of different</p>
<p>assets that I have I can see at the</p>
<p>moment they're all green so pretty happy</p>
<p>with those I can also see key outcomes</p>
<p>and I'll drill into much more detail on</p>
<p>each of these but it's really around how</p>
<p>can we make sure that we are outcomes</p>
<p>focused that we provide contextual</p>
<p>metadata context for decision makers how</p>
<p>do we focus on the asset itself and the</p>
<p>asset performance how can we provide</p>
<p>Advanced analysis as well as</p>
<p>collaboration and all of this and also</p>
<p>you know how do we provide access to</p>
<p>knowledge all in a common operating</p>
<p>picture</p>
<p>so with that</p>
<p>I'll get into a little bit more detail</p>
<p>on how we compose the digital twins for</p>
<p>us it's a three-step process the first</p>
<p>step is</p>
<p>orchestrating all of this data the</p>
<p>second part is and in a visual way the</p>
<p>second part is creating the visual</p>
<p>experience in this instance it's a it's</p>
<p>a desktop app but it could be mobile it</p>
<p>could be Irv or any one of those and</p>
<p>then how do we create recommendations</p>
<p>because that's a key thing you actually</p>
<p>the real outcome that you're looking for</p>
<p>is the actions that come from</p>
<p>recommendations so if I touch on the</p>
<p>first part in terms of how we build this</p>
<p>orchestration what you'll see here is</p>
<p>typically how we do it at XM Pro we've</p>
<p>got a visual drag and drop data stream</p>
<p>designer and with this I can now bring</p>
<p>in information from the router and the</p>
<p>gearbox the power the your pitch all of</p>
<p>that from other Telemetry using mqtt</p>
<p>these are all draggable blocks under</p>
<p>listeners there's a whole Library it's</p>
<p>extensible Library</p>
<p>um and I can drag these on I can then do</p>
<p>some and I can bring contacts like make</p>
<p>model and all that from Maxima in this</p>
<p>instance I can then transform that data</p>
<p>so there's a whole range there's a whole</p>
<p>bunch of blocks that are all around uh</p>
<p>Transformations doing calculations and</p>
<p>all of that</p>
<p>um I can add clean Wrangle data in all</p>
<p>of that and then the next step is</p>
<p>applying some AI to it you can see I'm</p>
<p>running a python model to predict</p>
<p>likelihood of failure there's anomaly on</p>
<p>the on the right top right I'm also</p>
<p>storing some data at the same time here</p>
<p>in in fluxdb as an action which is</p>
<p>action agent and on the right hand side</p>
<p>we then run a recommendation which is</p>
<p>also there are different variations all</p>
<p>blocks that I can drag on so this is a</p>
<p>visual way to build and then the data</p>
<p>flows based on the frequency that I'm</p>
<p>specifying for this as well what we've</p>
<p>added to this now is the ability to</p>
<p>bring in jupyter Notebook so we have our</p>
<p>AI designer which is</p>
<p>embedded in the product as well so I can</p>
<p>run some of that logic Advanced logic</p>
<p>correct models simulations all of that</p>
<p>running jupyter notebooks as part of</p>
<p>that data stream which is a key part of</p>
<p>bringing intelligence to data to to</p>
<p>digital twins</p>
<p>the next part is to make it look pretty</p>
<p>so the visualizations as I mentioned you</p>
<p>can bring in objects from external</p>
<p>things like Gia systems example of</p>
<p>Israel and also recommendations from the</p>
<p>recommendation engine showing me where</p>
<p>they are they are potential challenges</p>
<p>this is outcomes Focus so you can see</p>
<p>call metrics I'll be doing better I'll</p>
<p>be getting worse what's my current view</p>
<p>on open work orders you know and I can</p>
<p>see the health and across my my</p>
<p>different assets pretty easily if I get</p>
<p>into the asset itself</p>
<p>I can start looking at the time profile</p>
<p>some of the calculations around</p>
<p>effective utilization the power that</p>
<p>it's in current real-time yo and pitch</p>
<p>and all that I can see some of the other</p>
<p>live metrics the recommendations</p>
<p>specifically for this one</p>
<p>um and I this could be a 2d graph or it</p>
<p>could be a Unity model it could be an</p>
<p>Omnibus visualization and</p>
<p>I also have my maintenance records from</p>
<p>my work order history and everything as</p>
<p>a again as a common operating picture</p>
<p>for someone who makes the needs to make</p>
<p>a decision right now I may want to do</p>
<p>further analysis on this compare</p>
<p>different turbines in the same Wind Farm</p>
<p>to each other or I need to have</p>
<p>contextual information around what's</p>
<p>happening right now on in the</p>
<p>environment I may need to speak to</p>
<p>someone</p>
<p>from the supplier of these or someone in</p>
<p>our operation centers around some issues</p>
<p>that I'm seeing there and I have to get</p>
<p>some documentation and supporting</p>
<p>information around this</p>
<p>and where this is all heading as you've</p>
<p>seen with things like chat GPT and what</p>
<p>we biking in as well as the ability to</p>
<p>now use that and interrogate inside for</p>
<p>example what are the failure modes and</p>
<p>whatever it causes potentially for what</p>
<p>I'm saying here so that's where this is</p>
<p>heading and this is all as part of the</p>
<p>visualization part in the middle the</p>
<p>next part is being able to create these</p>
<p>recommendations and in this instance I</p>
<p>can just see some of the real-time data</p>
<p>around what happened</p>
<p>and then I can create a work order in</p>
<p>this instance so this will automatically</p>
<p>then create the work order back into my</p>
<p>existing system that I have like sap or</p>
<p>Maxima or whatever it may be</p>
<p>and I can do some analysis on how many</p>
<p>times we've seen this across this</p>
<p>equipment so a lot more to this I'm just</p>
<p>skimming over this pretty quick but</p>
<p>that's kind of the other core element of</p>
<p>an interactive digital twin which leads</p>
<p>me to where is this all going so what is</p>
<p>the future and um again I had the</p>
<p>opportunity to work with Dr Michael</p>
<p>Greaves</p>
<p>um and uh at the digital tone Consortium</p>
<p>and he's got this view of intelligent</p>
<p>digital twins for me it is it is a</p>
<p>integrated intelligent interactive</p>
<p>composable environment that we need so</p>
<p>we need to make sure that at standard</p>
<p>space API models as I showed at the past</p>
<p>need to make sure and what we're seeing</p>
<p>is executable AI as I've shown you where</p>
<p>we've got the Jupiter notebooks and</p>
<p>those embedded python running inside so</p>
<p>I can get the smarts of my Engineers</p>
<p>into those data streams Innovation AI</p>
<p>being able to run things like front</p>
<p>running simulation similar to what we</p>
<p>have in Formula One where I can speed up</p>
<p>the environment and kind of see what's</p>
<p>what's likely to happen again this is</p>
<p>all possible right now and then</p>
<p>augmenting or augmented AI for making</p>
<p>the digital twins smarter so taking</p>
<p>putting AI over the data that we're</p>
<p>collecting and see how can we improve</p>
<p>and make them smarter so we can get some</p>
<p>machine intelligence</p>
<p>um out of this from an interactive point</p>
<p>of view looking at making it more</p>
<p>um AI enabled so that they recommend for</p>
<p>recommendations and prescriptive</p>
<p>analytics creating multi-user</p>
<p>experiences that are that are more</p>
<p>collaborative generative and then also</p>
<p>we don't know where the industrial</p>
<p>minivers is going to end up or what it's</p>
<p>going to look like</p>
<p>um but the digital twins will be the</p>
<p>core building blocks for the industrial</p>
<p>metavers</p>
<p>and all of this in a composable way so</p>
<p>we can reuse</p>
<p>um what we're doing</p>
