<summary>Transcript</summary>hello everybody and welcome to our XM
<p>Pro AI</p>
<p>um for intelligent digital twins webinar</p>
<p>my name is Kevin green I look after</p>
<p>strategic solutions for XM Pro I want to</p>
<p>thank you for your time attending today</p>
<p>if you've got any questions please send</p>
<p>them through I'm not trying to answer</p>
<p>them at the at the end</p>
<p>in some prior webinars we went through</p>
<p>the four pillars of the the excellent</p>
<p>product I'm not going to go into detail</p>
<p>here</p>
<p>but just in a continuation of that which</p>
<p>pieces are we going to be focusing on</p>
<p>this is in line with our i3c framework</p>
<p>and it's in essence where we focus our</p>
<p>effort when we're putting the product to</p>
<p>Market and the different feature sets</p>
<p>that we are are working on</p>
<p>today's Focus however is going to be on</p>
<p>the AI side of things and what is in the</p>
<p>product that can help you for the</p>
<p>intelligent digital twins with the the</p>
<p>focus on the AI site</p>
<p>before we jump into you'll hear me</p>
<p>talking around intelligent digital Twins</p>
<p>and digital Twins and there is a</p>
<p>difference between the two of those</p>
<p>there was a paper that was written on</p>
<p>the evolution of digital twins</p>
<p>um the two fathers of digital twins</p>
<p>Being John Vickers and the second being</p>
<p>Dr Michael Greaves</p>
<p>um this is Dr Michael greve's vision of</p>
<p>the different stages of evolution of</p>
<p>digital twins these are some slides from</p>
<p>the paper the paper is available down</p>
<p>the bottom and if you're interested we</p>
<p>can send you the link where you can</p>
<p>access the paper as well and it outlines</p>
<p>the different stages and it's also used</p>
<p>as inspiration and a guide within our</p>
<p>software and what it is that we do the</p>
<p>the main Evolution steps you'll see them</p>
<p>on the right there going from zero being</p>
<p>traditional 2D</p>
<p>that evolved into transitional so you're</p>
<p>number one which was 3D cat that went</p>
<p>into number two around the conceptual</p>
<p>this is where</p>
<p>um things started becoming a lot more</p>
<p>model based and then that evolved into</p>
<p>the concept of a digital twin platform</p>
<p>the step number three this is where most</p>
<p>people are at the moment</p>
<p>and they are slowly moving towards the</p>
<p>the number four which is around</p>
<p>intelligent digital twins one of the</p>
<p>applications for intelligent digital</p>
<p>twins is front running simulation it's</p>
<p>by no means the the only one it's just</p>
<p>the one that's front of mind which helps</p>
<p>explain the intelligent aspect of that</p>
<p>as well</p>
<p>when we start comparing digital Twins</p>
<p>versus intelligent digital twins there</p>
<p>are certain characteristics of a digital</p>
<p>twin and then there are characteristics</p>
<p>of an intelligent digital twin I've just</p>
<p>built the slides here again I'm not</p>
<p>going to go into into detail here the QR</p>
<p>code in the middle will take you to a</p>
<p>video which will go into a lot more</p>
<p>around the digital twin capabilities and</p>
<p>characteristics and the intelligent on</p>
<p>the other side</p>
<p>the one piece right at the bottom is the</p>
<p>anticipatory or the front running</p>
<p>simulation side of things</p>
<p>keeping with the the XM Pro product</p>
<p>within our intelligent digital twin</p>
<p>suite for those of you who are familiar</p>
<p>you're familiar with the data stream</p>
<p>designer the DS the app designer which</p>
<p>is the ad here and the subscription</p>
<p>manager of the SM here</p>
<p>the new one which you may not have seen</p>
<p>is around the AI side</p>
<p>rounding out the intelligent digital</p>
<p>twin Suite here</p>
<p>we'll go into that quite a bit of what</p>
<p>I'm going to walk you through you can do</p>
<p>without and I'll touch on some of those</p>
<p>areas where you can and then also touch</p>
<p>on the areas where you do need the the</p>
<p>newest addition here which would be on</p>
<p>the on the AI side</p>
<p>we have to stop in at the tip of the</p>
<p>iceberg where does it slot in so when</p>
<p>most people look at our digital Twins</p>
<p>and this is true for normal digital turn</p>
<p>platforms all the way through to</p>
<p>intelligent digital turns as well as</p>
<p>most people look at the top and they see</p>
<p>the uis there's actually a lot of things</p>
<p>that sit underneath</p>
<p>which is where the recommendations come</p>
<p>in and this is also where we slot in the</p>
<p>AI aspect as well the AI integration the</p>
<p>notebooks as well as how you</p>
<p>operationalize this for the agents you</p>
<p>still have everything else as you are</p>
<p>used to you've still got your data</p>
<p>stream and you've got your subscription</p>
<p>manager as well</p>
<p>we're going to leave the slides here and</p>
<p>we're going to jump into the actual</p>
<p>software itself and we're going to go</p>
<p>through a few examples of what it is</p>
<p>that I'm actually talking about here</p>
<p>so what we put together is we created an</p>
<p>app which will just allow me to walk</p>
<p>through the different bits and pieces</p>
<p>that we've got</p>
<p>let me just get rid of my slides</p>
<p>and we'll come back to to this</p>
<p>so again this is all driven from an</p>
<p>overarching framework which is what we</p>
<p>call our i3c</p>
<p>um and it's broken up into a few</p>
<p>different areas specifically with an AI</p>
<p>Focus for today we're talking around</p>
<p>Innovative embedded and augmented but</p>
<p>how do they all fit together where do</p>
<p>they all work together</p>
<p>we like pictures so we like explaining</p>
<p>how all of these fit together</p>
<p>as it is right now without having to</p>
<p>upgrade any accent Pro you can do</p>
<p>everything on the right here we call</p>
<p>that embedded AI</p>
<p>from the data stream designer how do you</p>
<p>bring the models in maybe you've already</p>
<p>got some models how do you</p>
<p>operationalize them and use them</p>
<p>everything else on the left here is some</p>
<p>of the new capability that we've brought</p>
<p>in with regards to Innovative AI as well</p>
<p>as augmented AI it's not required you</p>
<p>don't have to you can choose to use this</p>
<p>or not use this as well</p>
<p>so as we go into these different areas</p>
<p>what do I mean when I start talking</p>
<p>around Innovative AI we start going into</p>
<p>Excel Pro notebooks and there's two main</p>
<p>items in here the one is around the</p>
<p>ability to discover</p>
<p>so you'll see on the left we have a new</p>
<p>tool and that'll open up what we call</p>
<p>accent Pro notebooks</p>
<p>within here for those who are familiar</p>
<p>and comfortable you'll notice a familiar</p>
<p>environment being a Jupiter notebook</p>
<p>that we've got here</p>
<p>so this allows you to discover work</p>
<p>through and come up with the different</p>
<p>models Etc</p>
<p>any of the libraries that you can use</p>
<p>within a jupyter notebook you can use in</p>
<p>here this particular example I've got</p>
<p>here you can see this is around</p>
<p>predicting and the the beverage industry</p>
<p>using linear regression</p>
<p>as I build through this particular</p>
<p>notebook here you can see I'm going to</p>
<p>import certain libraries and it's going</p>
<p>to walk me through the different pieces</p>
<p>here so if there's a library that</p>
<p>I need for my machine learning or I want</p>
<p>to do some data Discovery I can load it</p>
<p>into the notebook not a problem at all</p>
<p>the other thing that as we work through</p>
<p>this that we've added into this is a</p>
<p>generative AI capability as well</p>
<p>what we mean by that is as I work</p>
<p>through this you'll notice at this point</p>
<p>here we've integrated chatgpt into this</p>
<p>environment as well so what that means</p>
<p>is you can actually use the chat GPT</p>
<p>to help augment and enrich what you're</p>
<p>looking for in here this example that</p>
<p>I've got in here what we're actually</p>
<p>asking</p>
<p>um chat GPT to do is to write me some</p>
<p>code on how to visualize the data that</p>
<p>I'm looking at I'm not an expert in how</p>
<p>I put this together so we're going to</p>
<p>ask and it'll actually generate</p>
<p>the items for me and if I go and run</p>
<p>that now you'll notice that it's going</p>
<p>to run and then it will generate and it</p>
<p>once it comes back it'll actually show</p>
<p>me the plot for the data that I'm</p>
<p>looking for</p>
<p>scroll a bit further down you'll</p>
<p>actually see what that looks like</p>
<p>if we keep going you can start</p>
<p>developing different models as well</p>
<p>if I come back here step one is really</p>
<p>what we call notebooks which allows you</p>
<p>to interact in an environment which is</p>
<p>familiar to you</p>
<p>you don't have to use them in here if</p>
<p>you do use them in here you can start</p>
<p>using some of the other features and the</p>
<p>bits and pieces that we've made</p>
<p>available as well if you have your own</p>
<p>models and you just want to use them and</p>
<p>plug them in by all means you can do</p>
<p>that already in the steps here</p>
<p>the second piece is really when we start</p>
<p>wanting to deploy models so there's two</p>
<p>main things that you can actually do</p>
<p>with the model</p>
<p>the one if I go into a different example</p>
<p>here is I can actually run this</p>
<p>it will generate the model I can help</p>
<p>discover that and the end result is I</p>
<p>can actually save this model to a file</p>
<p>that I cannot use inside the data stream</p>
<p>you can do the same thing right now</p>
<p>let's say you have a jupyter notebook</p>
<p>that sits outside X and pro you've</p>
<p>already doing Discovery you're already</p>
<p>generating models how do you just use</p>
<p>those models and bring them in you can</p>
<p>do that and I'll show you in a data</p>
<p>stream as well</p>
<p>the second thing that we're doing in the</p>
<p>prior example though is we're actually</p>
<p>fitting this model and passing it to a</p>
<p>repository and the reason for this is we</p>
<p>want to introduce a concept of</p>
<p>governance</p>
<p>and make sure that there is a framework</p>
<p>that you can actually deploy into and</p>
<p>that your models can live so that you</p>
<p>don't end up with a an Excel of machine</p>
<p>learning model sitting everywhere no one</p>
<p>knows it's got the latest version of</p>
<p>where it's actually sitting</p>
<p>if you have your own repository by all</p>
<p>means you can actually hook into and use</p>
<p>that as well this example here we're</p>
<p>just talking to to Mr flow as the</p>
<p>repository this is just one example it</p>
<p>is not the only example so if you've</p>
<p>already got one by all means you can</p>
<p>just plug that in and actually use that</p>
<p>as I continue to step through all of</p>
<p>this what it's doing is it's working out</p>
<p>the model it's working out the pieces</p>
<p>and then it is actually publishing that</p>
<p>model to my ml flow repository for me</p>
<p>you'll see it has already existed it's</p>
<p>going to created me a version 5 of that</p>
<p>model and now I can go into my actual</p>
<p>repository and decide when I want to</p>
<p>deploy that or elevate it to production</p>
<p>or not</p>
<p>so if we jump into that and again this</p>
<p>is just one example that we've got it's</p>
<p>not the only repository you can see the</p>
<p>one that we've just pushed through now</p>
<p>so number four is the one which is</p>
<p>currently in production I cannot decide</p>
<p>that number five is ready to go and I</p>
<p>can transition it to staging in a</p>
<p>controlled environment versus working</p>
<p>out well which is my live running model</p>
<p>which one isn't and how do you in a</p>
<p>governance structure move between the</p>
<p>different Frameworks that we're actually</p>
<p>looking at here</p>
<p>number four is currently published and</p>
<p>I'll show you now where that is actually</p>
<p>published and running</p>
<p>so if we come back here we call that</p>
<p>Innovative AI so if I come back to the</p>
<p>diagram that we're looking at here this</p>
<p>is the area that we are working in at</p>
<p>the moment is how do we take training</p>
<p>data how do we ask for specific results</p>
<p>that we are looking for and how do we</p>
<p>run that through a notebook you can't</p>
<p>augment that with chat GPT in this</p>
<p>example and then deploy that to an ml</p>
<p>Ops platform of your choice</p>
<p>you don't have to deploy it you can just</p>
<p>take the actual raw artifact which is a</p>
<p>result of that model and then use it in</p>
<p>a data stream as well</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>preferred or the more governance driven</p>
<p>process is to actually push that through</p>
<p>a</p>
<p>repository because then you get</p>
<p>everything that comes with the</p>
<p>repository as well</p>
<p>I mentioned you can do things right now</p>
<p>you don't need to upgrade or get all the</p>
<p>newest toys in the Box to to be able to</p>
<p>do this this is around the embedded AI</p>
<p>side so if I go into and this will open</p>
<p>up my data stream designer for me</p>
<p>you can do this right now you can drag</p>
<p>on this example has got a python runtime</p>
<p>running here which is running a model</p>
<p>this model was created inside the</p>
<p>notebook it was outputted from The</p>
<p>Notebook and then manually put into the</p>
<p>data stream and used and this is</p>
<p>capability that you can do as I</p>
<p>mentioned right now we call that how do</p>
<p>you use it from a manual perspective</p>
<p>what you'll also notice is there are a</p>
<p>lot of other items in the library</p>
<p>so if python is just being one of them</p>
<p>but let's say you want to use a more</p>
<p>standard algorithm like anomaly</p>
<p>detection or binary classification or</p>
<p>clustering</p>
<p>those agents already exist you can just</p>
<p>drag them on and use them right now</p>
<p>there's nothing stopping you you do not</p>
<p>need a repository you do not need to use</p>
<p>the Excel Pro notebook to take um</p>
<p>advantage of that particular capability</p>
<p>however if you do use a repository</p>
<p>and you actually want to integrate and</p>
<p>make use of that inside the data stream</p>
<p>what we've got here is we're performing</p>
<p>the analysis so this is using the Mr</p>
<p>flow agent so on the left you will see</p>
<p>here is a list of library</p>
<p>one of those being the ml flow</p>
<p>the Mr flow is talking to the repository</p>
<p>and here you can see the actual model</p>
<p>that it's talking to and everything else</p>
<p>is governed as well so I don't need to</p>
<p>remember the URLs I don't need to</p>
<p>remember logons passwords Etc I just</p>
<p>want to use that particular model and</p>
<p>actually just run it and execute it</p>
<p>again this is your governance that sits</p>
<p>around it it makes sure that the models</p>
<p>which you're using to do anomaly</p>
<p>detection Predictive Analytics maybe</p>
<p>you're using it to do forecasting or to</p>
<p>do front running simulation or just to</p>
<p>do normal simulation of current state or</p>
<p>past State you want to make sure that</p>
<p>you're running on the correct model</p>
<p>latest model and that you have control</p>
<p>of that you can do that inside the data</p>
<p>streams that we're looking at in here</p>
<p>so again if we come back</p>
<p>Innovative AI this is a really around</p>
<p>the ability to discover</p>
<p>go in through the particular notebooks</p>
<p>and then how do you use some of those</p>
<p>libraries in there the other example in</p>
<p>here is you can actually just create</p>
<p>models that do simulation so you don't</p>
<p>need to create models that do very</p>
<p>sophisticated</p>
<p>um AI number crunching and algorithms at</p>
<p>output you can do something as simple as</p>
<p>just simulation which is what this</p>
<p>particular example here is doing we're</p>
<p>creating a network we are then deploying</p>
<p>the same model to the repository again</p>
<p>you don't have to</p>
<p>There's an actual example of this one</p>
<p>running just the python itself with the</p>
<p>simulation on top of that as well</p>
<p>this one here is doing a remaining</p>
<p>useful life as well as a more advanced</p>
<p>prediction on the data coming in the one</p>
<p>that I just showed you is doing more</p>
<p>simulation so it caters to to both</p>
<p>there's no</p>
<p>you can do one and not the other</p>
<p>if we go into the augmented side</p>
<p>let me expand that a bit here so</p>
<p>embedded again you can do this right now</p>
<p>there's nothing stopping you from using</p>
<p>the current set of libraries and we're</p>
<p>expanding and adding to those all the</p>
<p>time</p>
<p>ml.net are some of those that you're</p>
<p>seeing in there ml flow when you're</p>
<p>talking to repositories maybe you want</p>
<p>to use some GPU enabled</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>algorithms from the the Nvidia Library</p>
<p>you can do all of that right now within</p>
<p>the embedded side of things</p>
<p>the Innovative is around the notebooks</p>
<p>but augmented is not just in the</p>
<p>notebook section over here</p>
<p>the augmented</p>
<p>AI you can actually use inside your apps</p>
<p>when you create and configure them as</p>
<p>well</p>
<p>what do I mean by that oh let's go into</p>
<p>an example</p>
<p>so I've got a particular app here and on</p>
<p>the right you'll see some</p>
<p>recommendations have triggered</p>
<p>these recommendations you can see</p>
<p>remaining useful life has been declining</p>
<p>and I can go a bit further down and I</p>
<p>can see remaining useful life has been</p>
<p>predicted to be below a certain</p>
<p>threshold again these were running</p>
<p>through the data stream and they can</p>
<p>either be Standalone python or any of</p>
<p>the other algorithms or read the matter</p>
<p>or repository and execute them as well</p>
<p>if I drill into that particular asset</p>
<p>it'll actually filter out my</p>
<p>recommendations for the two that I'm</p>
<p>interested in across the top you can</p>
<p>actually view the state of the model and</p>
<p>you can view the state of the data</p>
<p>that's flowing through the model so</p>
<p>actual versus predictive how are we</p>
<p>doing are we getting better we're</p>
<p>getting worse</p>
<p>if you apply this to simulation you</p>
<p>could have a button here that you could</p>
<p>click and it can actually show you the</p>
<p>progression of a simulation as it's</p>
<p>running through the uh the model itself</p>
<p>these recommendations here</p>
<p>you'll see above that there's a thing</p>
<p>called copilot copilot you can actually</p>
<p>bring into the application and use it in</p>
<p>here so if I was to ask it a question</p>
<p>let me just grab my prompt</p>
<p>and paste that in there</p>
<p>I can engage and talk with it and ask it</p>
<p>anything around this particular asset</p>
<p>that I'm interested in</p>
<p>this is using currently chat GPT so the</p>
<p>the data that I'm looking for here is</p>
<p>not sensitive in that regard however we</p>
<p>do have some OEM</p>
<p>Partners who have gone and taken as an</p>
<p>example Azure open Ai and they are using</p>
<p>that on their own data their documents</p>
<p>their manuals and they've deployed that</p>
<p>internally as well</p>
<p>this is just easier to to demonstrate</p>
<p>and show the concept of how you can plug</p>
<p>this in and where we are busy plugin the</p>
<p>different bits and pieces in so even</p>
<p>though this is using a chapter GPT API</p>
<p>here you could switch this out and put</p>
<p>azure's open AI in here as well a lot of</p>
<p>problem to do that</p>
<p>you'll see the the recommendations</p>
<p>coming down</p>
<p>you can go and expand that further and</p>
<p>actually pass these recommendations into</p>
<p>the assets themselves so here you can</p>
<p>see a discharge exception and I can</p>
<p>actually see that in this particular</p>
<p>Unity view as well I've got more space</p>
<p>for my co-pilot</p>
<p>um but I can still see the relevant</p>
<p>information that is applicable for me</p>
<p>if I drill into these recommendations</p>
<p>and I'll drill into this one as an</p>
<p>example and then I'll open a few others</p>
<p>as well</p>
<p>this is your quick start for</p>
<p>recommendations that you've configured</p>
<p>what I mean by quick start</p>
<p>so let me go all the way back here and</p>
<p>open up a different example for you</p>
<p>so when I say quick start you have</p>
<p>certain capability that is available out</p>
<p>the box you get it when you install and</p>
<p>you can just use it there's some other</p>
<p>capability that you can actually</p>
<p>configure within the platform as well so</p>
<p>we have a lot of different widgets we</p>
<p>have a lot of different applications</p>
<p>that you can just import we have a lot</p>
<p>of different templates</p>
<p>one of those templates is around</p>
<p>recommendations so you'll see at the top</p>
<p>I've actually got two sets of</p>
<p>recommendations on this particular page</p>
<p>for the Top If I go into my one example</p>
<p>this is the recommendations that most</p>
<p>people are familiar with XM Pro would</p>
<p>actually be looking at</p>
<p>this is the the Quick Start</p>
<p>you can't really change anything here</p>
<p>from an end user's experience or even</p>
<p>from someone who's configuring it you do</p>
<p>have some some control over the form and</p>
<p>maybe the triage instructions here but</p>
<p>that's about it you can't change any of</p>
<p>the layout you can't add anything to</p>
<p>this particular form maybe you want to</p>
<p>enhance and bring some other data in</p>
<p>some other capability in here as well</p>
<p>so how do you actually do that</p>
<p>if we go down the bottom</p>
<p>you can actually take all of that data</p>
<p>and make it available in different views</p>
<p>that your end users are interested in</p>
<p>consuming</p>
<p>same data presented a bit differently</p>
<p>but what this allows us to do is we can</p>
<p>now bring in let me hit my other prompt</p>
<p>there we can now bring in the copilot</p>
<p>into here as well and this is around dry</p>
<p>gas seals I can see my event data for</p>
<p>the event that has happened I can see</p>
<p>analytics so how often is this actually</p>
<p>happening is there something that</p>
<p>happens at certain times is it happening</p>
<p>when other events are happening as well</p>
<p>so we're dealing with a pressure seal</p>
<p>that is low we may have some high</p>
<p>temperatures maybe all of this is</p>
<p>related and there is a correlation</p>
<p>between these as well</p>
<p>however if we go a bit further down you</p>
<p>can bring the copilot in here as well</p>
<p>so now you've got a co-pilot which you</p>
<p>can deploy and use on an actual</p>
<p>application itself at an asset level or</p>
<p>maybe all the way up at a landing page</p>
<p>for your different views or you can have</p>
<p>a view where you can have it all the way</p>
<p>down with your recommendation data as</p>
<p>well</p>
<p>so now as an end user I can decide and I</p>
<p>can work through and work out based on</p>
<p>what I'm looking at based on what I've</p>
<p>asked and the responses I am getting do</p>
<p>I need to create a work request can I</p>
<p>capture any notes what do I actually</p>
<p>need to do with this recommendation that</p>
<p>I'm looking at here</p>
<p>and again this recommendation was</p>
<p>triggered from within the data streams</p>
<p>you'll see there is a run recommendation</p>
<p>if I go into the other example you'll</p>
<p>see there is a run recommendation as</p>
<p>well so we apply the same patterns in</p>
<p>our data streams irrespective or if if</p>
<p>you're using a model that is coming from</p>
<p>a repository</p>
<p>in this case this one is coming from a</p>
<p>repository or if you're using some of</p>
<p>the standard inbuilt</p>
<p>algorithms are already there or if you</p>
<p>just want to go and run your own model</p>
<p>and actually use that in here as well</p>
<p>they all follow the same pattern the</p>
<p>output of that you can pass to</p>
<p>recommendations and Trigger</p>
<p>recommendations as well because that's a</p>
<p>key thing for us is making sure that we</p>
<p>can close the loop on any of these</p>
<p>events that we find it's one thing to</p>
<p>just have a model it's how do you</p>
<p>operationalize the model and make it</p>
<p>useful</p>
<p>with the outputs that are coming</p>
<p>this view here</p>
<p>you can then look at the data you can</p>
<p>view any of the model information and</p>
<p>now you have a lot of different options</p>
<p>and how you want to react to that</p>
<p>if I close that</p>
<p>and we come back to this particular view</p>
<p>here</p>
<p>so to go through the the items that</p>
<p>we've just gone through</p>
<p>we talk around Innovation AI</p>
<p>embedded AI as well as augmented AI</p>
<p>embedded AI you can do right now</p>
<p>we have the libraries we have the agents</p>
<p>if you need specific agents for specific</p>
<p>algorithms they're pretty quick and easy</p>
<p>to create they need to talk to a certain</p>
<p>repository you don't want to use the one</p>
<p>that I've just shown here maybe you've</p>
<p>already got your own</p>
<p>those agents can be created very quickly</p>
<p>and deployed and used</p>
<p>on the augmented AI site</p>
<p>you can right now bring in</p>
<p>if I open that up again you can bring in</p>
<p>things like co-pilot into your</p>
<p>applications right now there's nothing</p>
<p>stopping you there's there's no</p>
<p>capability that you're missing to do</p>
<p>that the only thing that I would suggest</p>
<p>is make sure that whatever it is that</p>
<p>you want to use here</p>
<p>um you understand the privacy concerns</p>
<p>with the data again we are using chat</p>
<p>GPT here we are busy I can't show you</p>
<p>the the things on the Azure open AI side</p>
<p>because that's typically trained and</p>
<p>running on corporate data or customer</p>
<p>specific data for their customer</p>
<p>so this you would just swap out same</p>
<p>capability exactly the same mechanism</p>
<p>it's just what's sitting behind that'll</p>
<p>actually change for you as well you can</p>
<p>do that right now</p>
<p>The Innovation piece here this is where</p>
<p>you need access to the excellent Pro</p>
<p>notebook here</p>
<p>to be able to run and configure what</p>
<p>you're looking at we do provide if I go</p>
<p>back into the router we do provide a</p>
<p>quick start as well</p>
<p>the quick start for if you're not</p>
<p>familiar with all the different</p>
<p>capabilities the markup that you need to</p>
<p>use and how you can configure this a</p>
<p>quick start will actually walk you</p>
<p>through as well it's available as soon</p>
<p>as you have access to the AI designer</p>
<p>you'll find it in the list here and it</p>
<p>has a index and it'll just run you</p>
<p>through all the bits and pieces you need</p>
<p>if you're interested in some of the</p>
<p>other examples that we've got you by all</p>
<p>means reach out and happy to happy to</p>
<p>discuss how we can share and learn from</p>
<p>this as well</p>
<p>okay let's see if we've got any of the</p>
<p>the questions we do have a few questions</p>
<p>that came in there so first one does XM</p>
<p>Pro have models</p>
<p>um great question we get that quite a</p>
<p>lot when people see all the different</p>
<p>pieces and capabilities we don't have</p>
<p>specific models that we make available</p>
<p>we're not a data science scientist</p>
<p>company</p>
<p>however we do have certain algorithms</p>
<p>that we do make available so for</p>
<p>instance anomaly detection regression</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>classifications Etc what we do do is</p>
<p>give you the vehicles and the tools to</p>
<p>operationalize your own models whether</p>
<p>those are coming out of a repository as</p>
<p>we did with this piece here or whether</p>
<p>those are coming out of a data stream</p>
<p>and you go and configure everything</p>
<p>whether it's in python or even if you're</p>
<p>more comfortable in our script and you</p>
<p>want to use that you can do that as well</p>
<p>so we're more vehicle that allows you to</p>
<p>operationalize versus do we have a model</p>
<p>that does X on this asset</p>
<p>second question</p>
<p>um I did touch on it a few times but</p>
<p>just to to go through it is I have my</p>
<p>own models and repository do you I need</p>
<p>to choose yours being XM Pro</p>
<p>uh or can that you can keep your own you</p>
<p>do not have to replace what you</p>
<p>currently have you do not have to swap</p>
<p>that out and use ours you can just</p>
<p>integrate from ours into yours that'll</p>
<p>mostly get done inside the data stream</p>
<p>from the agent's perspective over here</p>
<p>again if there isn't an agent that will</p>
<p>connect to your repository of choice</p>
<p>it's pretty quick and easy to actually</p>
<p>create these types of Agents we can</p>
<p>create them on your behalf quite a few</p>
<p>of our partners do that as well or we</p>
<p>can even show you how to create these</p>
<p>yourself as well</p>
<p>the last thing I will leave you with</p>
<p>is just before we wrap up again thank</p>
<p>you for your time</p>
<p>um to today and we do have a webinar</p>
<p>coming out next month as well where</p>
<p>we're going to be talking about the 4.3</p>
<p>release</p>
<p>um the QR code here will take you</p>
<p>directly to the registration page if</p>
<p>you're more comfortable you can type the</p>
<p>link in and go from there if you have</p>
<p>any questions</p>
<p>um you can email me directly or just</p>
<p>sales at actionpro.com and again thank</p>
<p>you for the uh the time today and have a</p>
<p>great rest of the day</p>
<p>foreign</p>
