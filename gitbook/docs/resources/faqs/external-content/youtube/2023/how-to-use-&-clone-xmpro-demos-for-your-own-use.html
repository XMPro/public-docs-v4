<p>Welcome to our XMPro tutorial on leveraging our wide range of demo applications! In this video, we guide you through the process of understanding, accessing, and cloning various demos that we've crafted for customers, partners, and illustrative scenarios. Here's what you'll learn:</p>
<p>ðŸ”¹ Why XMPro offers multiple demos and their primary intent. ðŸ”¹ A walkthrough of the app interface, from accessing live data to checking out app configurations. ðŸ”¹ The simple steps to edit and understand how each element in an app is configured, and the ease of identifying data sources. ðŸ”¹ The assurance of read-only access, ensuring that you can explore without the fear of unintentionally altering anything. ðŸ”¹ The powerful 'Clone' feature that lets you duplicate any app, recommendation, or data stream to experiment and build upon. ðŸ”¹ Insight into how you, as our partner, have special access to a wealth of resources to enhance your XMPro experience.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, these demos are meant to boost your understanding and speed up your app creation process, but they aren't ready for direct production use. Instead, use them as a stepping stone to understand XMPro's capabilities and create your unique applications. Dive in and discover the possibilities with XMPro!</p>

<summary>Transcript</summary>
<p>now the reason why you are seeing so</p>
<p>many options in here is what we did is</p>
<p>we loaded all these examples these are</p>
<p>examples that we put in here that we've</p>
<p>configured previously</p>
<p>for other customers other partners or</p>
<p>just some scenarios to to help explain</p>
<p>some of the things that we've</p>
<p>we've put together it's also used as a</p>
<p>starting point</p>
<p>so for instance if you go into any one</p>
<p>of these so let's say you go to the heat</p>
<p>exchanger one over here</p>
<p>and you like the look and feel of this</p>
<p>app you have access to it you'll see</p>
<p>it's got live data coming through it's</p>
<p>got recommendations here it's got a</p>
<p>chart down the bottom let's say you like</p>
<p>it and you want to use this app and just</p>
<p>extend it and add onto it you can do</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>how you do that is you see the pencil</p>
<p>over here</p>
<p>you click the edit every single one of</p>
<p>you has read read access to this which</p>
<p>means you can click the pencil what that</p>
<p>means is you'll be able to open the app</p>
<p>but you can't edit it that means you</p>
<p>can't break it so don't don't worry</p>
<p>about well I don't want to go into these</p>
<p>in case I break it or you know make a</p>
<p>change you can't do that</p>
<p>if it's published it can't be edited</p>
<p>however you can actually have a look at</p>
<p>how it was configured so for instance</p>
<p>you can see the yellow has</p>
<p>um around the box that tells me there's</p>
<p>a data source on it if I click that box</p>
<p>and I go to the properties you can see</p>
<p>okay so there's my data source which is</p>
<p>telemetry</p>
<p>I can go to the page date and I can see</p>
<p>well there is my Fields that's in the</p>
<p>data source click the pencil</p>
<p>and the pencil will actually show you</p>
<p>and tell you okay so it's getting it</p>
<p>from that data stream so smart assets</p>
<p>that data stream so now you can go into</p>
<p>the data stream and you can do the same</p>
<p>thing here</p>
<p>you can go into for instance smart</p>
<p>assets</p>
<p>and you can see there is the data stream</p>
<p>you have access to the data stream as</p>
<p>well and you can see there is the data</p>
<p>stream that is actually being used to</p>
<p>pass data through to this particular app</p>
<p>so you can see if I double click this</p>
<p>and it looks very similar to what you</p>
<p>configured this is just using the event</p>
<p>simulator</p>
<p>a broadcast so we can run</p>
<p>recommendations if you do the end-to-end</p>
<p>training it'll show you the Run</p>
<p>recommendations</p>
<p>um and walk through that for you what</p>
<p>you'll see here we're only looking for</p>
<p>one record so I want one end one record</p>
<p>at a time cash per entity and you'll see</p>
<p>asset number is my identifier in here</p>
<p>so you have access to these as well</p>
<p>again read access</p>
<p>once you get comfortable we can give you</p>
<p>right access to to these as well the</p>
<p>other reason why you've got access to</p>
<p>these is you don't have to create the</p>
<p>sort from scratch</p>
<p>so let's say you actually want to use</p>
<p>part of this app and you want to extend</p>
<p>this app if you go here to the main app</p>
<p>view so how I get there is you can</p>
<p>either scroll left or just close this</p>
<p>page</p>
<p>so here is the main app you click more</p>
<p>you can see Cloud you can clone the</p>
<p>whole app</p>
<p>you can do that for any of the apps in</p>
<p>here so as an example let's say you go</p>
<p>into the smart</p>
<p>let's go into this example</p>
<p>let's say you you like some of the</p>
<p>things that were in this particular</p>
<p>example and you want to copy it or clone</p>
<p>it or use it let's say</p>
<p>the pump view so let's have a look at</p>
<p>this view here you'll see there's a 2d</p>
<p>there's some live visuals there's all</p>
<p>the data coming down the bottom here</p>
<p>there's a 3D section as well</p>
<p>you want to use this as a starting point</p>
<p>versus</p>
<p>going from there</p>
<p>now</p>
<p>in this particular view here</p>
<p>to be able to clone it you do the same</p>
<p>thing you click the pencil</p>
<p>and you just go into the Clone section</p>
<p>you can clone the whole app and make</p>
<p>changes to it we've given you access to</p>
<p>a lot of examples because you're a</p>
<p>partner of ours you get access to a few</p>
<p>more things in here so you can clone all</p>
<p>the apps as you want to</p>
<p>you can clone recommendations as well so</p>
<p>on the left you'll see here's</p>
<p>recommendations you can go into there's</p>
<p>a whole bunch of recommendations that</p>
<p>you all have access to as well</p>
<p>same principle applies here you can go</p>
<p>to more and you can clone the</p>
<p>recommendation give it a name that</p>
<p>makes sense to you and then you can play</p>
<p>around with it you can change it see how</p>
<p>it works get comfortable break it delete</p>
<p>it but you can't change the the current</p>
<p>running ones that are there so you don't</p>
<p>have to worry about that</p>
<p>and then the last is obviously the data</p>
<p>streams as well that you also have</p>
<p>access to those that you can clone and</p>
<p>use those from from that perspective the</p>
<p>intent is this is to help you create and</p>
<p>configure apps to get out of the gate</p>
<p>pretty quickly these are not production</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>uh you know ready samples if I can call</p>
<p>it that so you can't really take one of</p>
<p>these and go put it into production at a</p>
<p>custom</p>
<p>it's not their intent their intent is to</p>
<p>show you different capabilities</p>
<p>um and and what you can actually work</p>
<p>through and configure</p>
<p>um and go through yeah</p>
