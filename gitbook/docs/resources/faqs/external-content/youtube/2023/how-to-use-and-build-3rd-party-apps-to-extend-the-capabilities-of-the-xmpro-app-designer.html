<p>{% embed url=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWR05zN6SNA&quot; %}</p>
<p>In today's video titled &quot;How To Use And Build 3rd Party Apps To Extend The Capabilities Of The XMPro App Designer,&quot; we delve deep into the world of app extensions. Here's a brief overview of what you'll discover:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand the layout and controls of the XMPro App Designer.</li>
<li>Discover the power of the 'embedded page' block for general purposes and when to opt for more tightly integrated blocks.</li>
<li>Uncover insights into more integrated options like the Unity view, the Azure map, and more.</li>
<li>Find out how XMPro collaborates with Nvidia Omniverse and explores expanding its library.</li>
<li>Get tips on how to relay feedback and use-case stories to enhance block integrations.</li>
<li>Dive into the agent section to explore the &quot;upload new model&quot; and learn about app creation for configuring Json files.</li>
<li>Join us to optimize the usage and expansion of the XMPro App Designer, and stay tuned for more tutorials and updates. If you're keen on embedding specific functionalities, this video is a must-watch! üöÄüõ†Ô∏èüì≤</li>

<summary>Transcript</summary>so there's there's a few different areas
<p>that you can or you have control of</p>
<p>extending um I'll go into the app</p>
<p>designer first so inside the app</p>
<p>designer this block section here</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>it's not easy for external people to</p>
<p>actually add your own Block in here so</p>
<p>let's say you you want to create a a</p>
<p>tableau block that you can drag on like</p>
<p>the power bi block currently</p>
<p>um that's something that our developers</p>
<p>would need to to do to to make it</p>
<p>available to be put in here there is an</p>
<p>iframe one in here though</p>
<p>so it's called embedded page over there</p>
<p>so you you can actually use the embedded</p>
<p>page to to do that however when you</p>
<p>start wanting to go down the road of</p>
<p>being a lot more tighter controlled or</p>
<p>tighter integrated to things to actually</p>
<p>bring that information in that's when it</p>
<p>would make a lot more sense to actually</p>
<p>say okay so as we start going down here</p>
<p>you'll see for instance there's a Unity</p>
<p>view which is a lot more integrated into</p>
<p>for instance Unity</p>
<p>or you would have a esri map which is a</p>
<p>lot more integrated into Azure map you</p>
<p>would have the power bi which has a lot</p>
<p>more integer so these ones here are a</p>
<p>lot tighter integrated from an</p>
<p>authentication and authorization</p>
<p>perspective there is this one here which</p>
<p>is the catch-all for lack of a better</p>
<p>word to to actually do that what it</p>
<p>might make sense is if you can</p>
<p>show me the example of what it is that</p>
<p>you're trying to embed from the Nvidia</p>
<p>perspective in here I could actually</p>
<p>take some of that to to our product team</p>
<p>and say this is what we're trying to do</p>
<p>here how do we</p>
<p>move things along accelerate things</p>
<p>along that type of thing because we're</p>
<p>also working with Nvidia Omniverse</p>
<p>um and actually expanding and extending</p>
<p>this Library here to do that on top of</p>
<p>some of the Nvidia AI models and things</p>
<p>like that as well the the other thing</p>
<p>that what we like to do is when people</p>
<p>do use embedded pages and things like</p>
<p>that is just let us know what you're</p>
<p>using it for and what the user stories</p>
<p>and the use case around it is</p>
<p>because as I say if it makes a lot more</p>
<p>sense to have a specific block on here</p>
<p>we call these blocks I have a specific</p>
<p>block on here for that particular system</p>
<p>that I can raise with the product team</p>
<p>and get it turned around pretty quickly</p>
<p>you know versus</p>
<p>trying to use the catch-all being the</p>
<p>embedded pitch if that makes sense</p>
<p>so inside the actual agent over here</p>
<p>you'll see there is a upload new model</p>
<p>what you can actually do as well is you</p>
<p>can from an app perspective actually</p>
<p>create an app that will allow you to</p>
<p>configure that Json file</p>
<p>so if I go into</p>
<p>I don't think I have a full example</p>
<p>um of that</p>
<p>but you could come in here and actually</p>
<p>configure your hierarchy configure your</p>
<p>your you know properties Etc and then</p>
<p>you could have an option here that says</p>
<p>well</p>
<p>deploy you can do that in here as well</p>
