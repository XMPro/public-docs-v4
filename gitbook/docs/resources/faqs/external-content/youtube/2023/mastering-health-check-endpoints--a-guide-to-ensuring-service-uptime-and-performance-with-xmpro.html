<p>{% embed url=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1LWcSUrgTs&quot; %}</p>
<p>Welcome to our guide on how to master health check endpoints for your product or service! Whether you're working with a cloud provider or an in-house team, understanding health check endpoints can be a game-changer for service uptime and performance.</p>
<p>üîó In this video, we focus on the importance of health check endpoints and how XMPro has effectively implemented them for better service health and diagnostics.</p>
<p>üîç Key Takeaways:</p>
<p>Health check endpoints are the industry standard for the first diagnostic step. They allow you to monitor the health of an API and its dependencies. You can configure alerts, email notifications, and auto-scaling based on the endpoint status. Self-healing functionalities can be enabled for greater uptime and performance. XMPro remains platform-independent, giving you flexibility in choosing your cloud provider.</p>

<summary>Transcript</summary>
<p>now a health check endpoint is precisely</p>
<p>as it sounds</p>
<p>a product service has a health check API</p>
<p>endpoint such as HTTP forward slash help</p>
<p>that Returns the help of the service</p>
<p>when it is called the API endpoint</p>
<p>Handler performs various checks and</p>
<p>responds with the simple status of the</p>
<p>API and its dependencies</p>
<p>are unhealthy</p>
<p>when it is troubleshooting health checks</p>
<p>are the industry standard for the first</p>
<p>diagnostic step</p>
<p>they quickly indicate connectivity</p>
<p>health</p>
<p>either highlighting an issue such as</p>
<p>access to a database</p>
<p>or allowing the troubleshooter to rule</p>
<p>out connectivity and move on to their</p>
<p>next check</p>
<p>we've implemented standard best practice</p>
<p>health check endpoints with two</p>
<p>different ways to consume this</p>
<p>information</p>
<p>in person or utilizing a diagnostic tool</p>
<p>as a baseline a person can monitor the</p>
<p>health UI which sits outside of our</p>
<p>product</p>
<p>has to or you wouldn't be able to access</p>
<p>it if our products were not healthy</p>
<p>however there is more to be gained by</p>
<p>configuring the raw Json API response to</p>
<p>be read by diagnostic tools such as</p>
<p>Azure with app insights</p>
<p>so that the endpoints are constantly</p>
<p>monitored on the infrastructure itself</p>
<p>you can build rules triggered if it goes</p>
<p>from healthy to unhealthy and when</p>
<p>triggered you can build actions such as</p>
<p>an email or a team's message or maybe</p>
<p>even to Auto scale</p>
<p>Health endpoints are crucial for</p>
<p>enabling self-healing functionalities in</p>
<p>your infrastructure</p>
<p>being able to automatically restart</p>
<p>unhealthy services on the edge</p>
<p>is extremely powerful in increasing</p>
<p>product uptime and performance</p>
<p>imagine if your application is running</p>
<p>on kubernetes and you can automatically</p>
<p>restart the service</p>
<p>or the Pod that it's running on and</p>
<p>hopefully get it back to a healthy state</p>
<p>health checks are particularly useful</p>
<p>for customer installations on their own</p>
<p>infrastructure</p>
<p>there's always a risk that connectivity</p>
<p>might not have been opened on a service</p>
<p>that exim Pro needs and it's not</p>
<p>transparent that this is the case</p>
<p>time has been lost in previous</p>
<p>installations going through that</p>
<p>diagnosis process</p>
<p>it requires certain skill sets so it</p>
<p>becomes time consuming and costly to</p>
<p>troubleshoot what may end up being a</p>
<p>trivial issue</p>
<p>with health checks now when you do the</p>
<p>initial installation you could for</p>
<p>example confirm application designer has</p>
<p>connectivity to subscription manager and</p>
<p>to its database</p>
<p>if it doesn't then we can tell straight</p>
<p>away that it can't connect and see the</p>
<p>relevant error message</p>
<p>the problem is narrowed down to</p>
<p>connectivity between two systems and</p>
<p>it's simple to proceed to The Next Step</p>
<p>which could be something like opening an</p>
<p>exception on the firewall</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>there are also day-to-day operations</p>
<p>where the environment in which XM Pro is</p>
<p>installed unexpectedly changes</p>
<p>whether it's the Cloud Server provide</p>
<p>running updates</p>
<p>sorry whether it's the cloud provider</p>
<p>running updates or deprecating</p>
<p>underlying functionality or the customer</p>
<p>themselves making changes</p>
<p>these endpoints are available so that XM</p>
<p>Pro connectivity can be actively</p>
<p>monitored</p>
<p>connectivity is inadvertently broken</p>
<p>someone can be proactively notified of</p>
<p>an issue and investigate further</p>
<p>the loss of connectivity assists in</p>
<p>knowing which area is working as</p>
<p>expected and which area to troubleshoot</p>
<p>Boda</p>
<p>let me take you to our product</p>
<p>documentation for a quick look</p>
<p>this is the</p>
<p>sorry this is the health path of an</p>
<p>application designer Services URL and</p>
<p>the raw API response</p>
<p>note the overall status is healthy and</p>
<p>that there is an entry for each of the</p>
<p>related product Service apis as well as</p>
<p>the database</p>
<p>observe the duration for each individual</p>
<p>check their healthy status as well as</p>
<p>the optional descriptive tags</p>
<p>next we'll look at the same information</p>
<p>using the Baseline help UI</p>
<p>here we can see in the top half the same</p>
<p>information for application designer but</p>
<p>it is a lot easier on the human eye</p>
<p>the overall status is healthy</p>
<p>and again there are entries for each</p>
<p>related product service API as well as</p>
<p>the database</p>
<p>observe again the duration for each</p>
<p>check their healthy status as well as</p>
<p>the optional descriptive tags</p>
<p>our documentation includes an example of</p>
<p>how to configure the Xin pro products as</p>
<p>well as how to add third-party systems</p>
<p>that have health endpoints</p>
<p>a reminder that how you choose to use</p>
<p>these in health checks is up to you</p>
<p>our product is decoupled from any</p>
<p>specific cloud provider so that XM Pro</p>
<p>remains platform independent</p>
