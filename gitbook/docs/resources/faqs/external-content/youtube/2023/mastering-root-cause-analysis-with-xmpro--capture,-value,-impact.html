<p>hello everybody and welcome to our last</p>
<p>webinar for 2023 um today I have the uh</p>
<p>pleasure of Nicole's company who's going</p>
<p>to run us through root cause analysis</p>
<p>application uh going through some</p>
<p>terminology um and then jumping into</p>
<p>some of the ex and pro specific uh</p>
<p>pieces can you drop to the next slide</p>
<p>please</p>
<p>ni you can just pull the whole slide um</p>
<p>some of the areas that we're going to</p>
<p>cover is um she's going to run you</p>
<p>through what is a root cause analysis</p>
<p>some types some benefits um an exm Pro</p>
<p>blueprint um around root cause analysis</p>
<p>and then we're going to touch on at the</p>
<p>end there just our general blueprints</p>
<p>accelerators and patterns as well um</p>
<p>next slide please so it's my great</p>
<p>pleasure to introduce to you our one of</p>
<p>our resident Engineers uh Nicole so</p>
<p>Nicole if you could just give everyone a</p>
<p>brief introduction and the floor is</p>
<p>yours sure thank you uh so my name is</p>
<p>the shinbach uh my background is in</p>
<p>mechanical engineering so a little bit</p>
<p>just about my previous roles uh before</p>
<p>being an engagement lead at XM Pro I was</p>
<p>a reliability engineer in a polymer</p>
<p>facility uh primary responsibilities</p>
<p>included PM improvements PM reviews uh</p>
<p>equipment upgrades or modifications</p>
<p>based off process changes as well as uh</p>
<p>root cause</p>
<p>analysis uh I also was a remote process</p>
<p>engineer that specialized in asset</p>
<p>condition monitoring this was primarily</p>
<p>through the use of iot sensors that</p>
<p>track vibration across um personally I</p>
<p>was uh over 15 different Building</p>
<p>Product and paper mill facilities trying</p>
<p>to prevent unplanned downtime on their</p>
<p>equipment my current role is an</p>
<p>engagement lead I've had a number of</p>
<p>clients um including we nutrient and so</p>
<p>primary</p>
<p>focus of um to create use cases to</p>
<p>basically capture and codify knowledge</p>
<p>you know to ensure it's not lost</p>
<p>especially when people retire as well as</p>
<p>to enhance and streamline current</p>
<p>workflows to solve any sort of problems</p>
<p>um that clients may</p>
<p>have so some basic terminology alignment</p>
<p>so first of all what is a root cause</p>
<p>analysis most people are familiar with</p>
<p>this term but uh just to clarify so root</p>
<p>cause analysis is the pro uh sorry root</p>
<p>cause analysis aims to identify the</p>
<p>causes of a problem in order to identify</p>
<p>actions to help solve the issues so um</p>
<p>at a high level right you want to you</p>
<p>want to be identifying the actual causes</p>
<p>of a failure not necessarily the</p>
<p>symptoms I shown on the diagram on the</p>
<p>Left Right the symptoms are</p>
<p>typically uh what you you know you</p>
<p>actually see I.E a pump bearing has</p>
<p>locked up but why has the pump bearing</p>
<p>locked up and so through the root cause</p>
<p>analysis process the aim is to address</p>
<p>these causes and not necessarily just</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>symptoms uh next going into the</p>
<p>different types of root cause</p>
<p>analysis so there are many many types of</p>
<p>root cause analysis um we're going to</p>
<p>focus primarily on the ones that are of</p>
<p>the you know cause and effect type</p>
<p>analysis I listed here three that are</p>
<p>quite popular the first is the 5y</p>
<p>approach this is what our solution is</p>
<p>Loosely based B off of um and we'll go</p>
<p>into that once I launch into the demo uh</p>
<p>at a high level of 5y is an iterative</p>
<p>technique to explore the causes and</p>
<p>effects of un underlying uh certain</p>
<p>issue so usually people describe this as</p>
<p>when a child basically asks you know why</p>
<p>something has happened and they</p>
<p>continually ask why eventually they give</p>
<p>up or they get the answer they want um</p>
<p>in the same fashion right if you keep</p>
<p>asking why you're going to get more and</p>
<p>more into the detailed uh</p>
<p>the details of a problem until you</p>
<p>actually reach the root</p>
<p>cause um next we have the fishbone</p>
<p>diagram also called the Ishikawa diagram</p>
<p>so this is a visual method to organize</p>
<p>the cause and effect relationship into</p>
<p>categories there is a little fish on</p>
<p>that diagram to the right that is</p>
<p>typically what the structure does look</p>
<p>like the head is typically the actual um</p>
<p>problem and then the associated bones</p>
<p>are the different categories of uh</p>
<p>causes so this is used across multiple</p>
<p>Industries and there's different uh</p>
<p>pneumonics that people typically use for</p>
<p>the categories one common one is the 6m</p>
<p>for manufacturing there's also I believe</p>
<p>a 4M there's different um there's</p>
<p>different M categories based on how many</p>
<p>categories you want to go through the 6m</p>
<p>is basically Manpower method machine</p>
<p>materials mother nature and measurements</p>
<p>so that's a good starting point when</p>
<p>your team wants to start putting</p>
<p>Associated causes underneath a larger</p>
<p>category um finally there is the Paro</p>
<p>chart so the Paro chart aims to identify</p>
<p>the frequency and impact of a problem it</p>
<p>sometimes follows the 8020 rule where</p>
<p>most um most problems 80% of the</p>
<p>problems are caused by 20% of the causes</p>
<p>and so in a Paro chart you know you're</p>
<p>looking at the leftmost of the chart</p>
<p>basically which is you know what uh what</p>
<p>issue are are happening at a high</p>
<p>frequency as well as causing the most</p>
<p>downtime so typically uh my experience</p>
<p>with this is that at the end of the year</p>
<p>it's a good look back of a cumulative</p>
<p>impact my reliability engineer would</p>
<p>usually sit down our team right go</p>
<p>through basically look this is the</p>
<p>frequency and impact of some issues and</p>
<p>you know try to assign work accordingly</p>
<p>for the next year to address</p>
<p>those next uh benefits of doing a root</p>
<p>cause analysis so why would you want to</p>
<p>do this right the main I guess the main</p>
<p>benefit to doing this is to prevent</p>
<p>reoccurrence of issues in the future</p>
<p>right the whole goal is basically X Y</p>
<p>and Z happen causing a failure right so</p>
<p>you're wanting to create action items to</p>
<p>resolve the root cause of a specific</p>
<p>failure versus a symptoms again</p>
<p>referencing the tree right the symptoms</p>
<p>are what you visually see or visually</p>
<p>happens and the root cause you know</p>
<p>that's what you need to ident identify</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>resolve additionally um improved team</p>
<p>communication so you know working with</p>
<p>your colleagues there's multiple</p>
<p>disciplines there's you know a cross</p>
<p>functional team that you know provides</p>
<p>support for the whole process right so</p>
<p>you need to ensure first of all that the</p>
<p>full picture is captured right so you</p>
<p>want to involve as many relevant people</p>
<p>as possible in your RCA process so</p>
<p>everything that is relevant is captured</p>
<p>understood and addressed via team</p>
<p>collaboration you also Al want</p>
<p>everyone's you know um input to ensure</p>
<p>everyone is on the same page and agrees</p>
<p>what the steps are to ensure this</p>
<p>problem does not happen again right</p>
<p>everyone needs to agree finally in terms</p>
<p>of documentation right this</p>
<p>documentation is important you first</p>
<p>want to you know validate that you have</p>
<p>done your due diligence you've captured</p>
<p>all the associated data and evidence uh</p>
<p>as well as Associated action items to</p>
<p>you know close the loop and ensure this</p>
<p>doesn't happen again and this is also a</p>
<p>great way to in um share across your</p>
<p>organization so if you're in</p>
<p>manufacturing typically you're going to</p>
<p>have you know Associated sister sites</p>
<p>that are doing a similar process to you</p>
<p>which might have the identical equipment</p>
<p>so ideally you're wanting to share your</p>
<p>experience with them obviously not a</p>
<p>great experience but to ensure that this</p>
<p>doesn't happen to them again right or</p>
<p>doesn't happen to them in the same way</p>
<p>that the failure has happened um your</p>
<p>site now in terms of the right diagram</p>
<p>so this is sort of how the different um</p>
<p>steps and uh pieces that you need to</p>
<p>fully complete an RCA uh the first is</p>
<p>the problem identification so basically</p>
<p>what has happened um and how you're</p>
<p>going to you know capture that so you</p>
<p>know X Y and Z failed at this time and</p>
<p>this impact the next is the data</p>
<p>collection portion so this is an</p>
<p>important portion where you know again</p>
<p>utilizing your cross functional team you</p>
<p>want to be gathering all the necessary</p>
<p>data so you know PM plan operations rout</p>
<p>process data anything of relevance to</p>
<p>your failure you need to capture in a</p>
<p>timeline so you can see you know</p>
<p>potentially when the actual issue</p>
<p>cropped up next cause mapping and</p>
<p>identifying the root cause right you're</p>
<p>actually performing the the root cause</p>
<p>analysis and identifying what the issue</p>
<p>is finally closing the loop you need to</p>
<p>create actions that are addressing the</p>
<p>root cause or causes and ensure that</p>
<p>they are implemented so this issue does</p>
<p>not happen</p>
<p>again so how does this process integrate</p>
<p>into our XM Pro existing process so</p>
<p>typically um you know depending on the</p>
<p>client there may be a very uh very</p>
<p>specific use case or problem that they</p>
<p>want to address or it might be something</p>
<p>more broad for example reducing</p>
<p>unplanned downtime right that's quite a</p>
<p>broad statement and that's you know</p>
<p>something OB ly very common amongst um</p>
<p>sites you want to ensure that um we're</p>
<p>trying to identify the right items to</p>
<p>address this issue so typically we go</p>
<p>through this process of we first</p>
<p>identify you know the Bad actors right</p>
<p>you can do that eventually via Paro</p>
<p>chart um you want to identify ones that</p>
<p>are you know either frequently failing</p>
<p>or causing a massive impact on</p>
<p>production um operations next you go</p>
<p>into the failure modes right what is</p>
<p>actually causing the this bad actor to</p>
<p>fail you need to identify that to</p>
<p>properly address it um and then you know</p>
<p>coming into the root causes so again uh</p>
<p>identifying the root causes is the most</p>
<p>important part because if you don't</p>
<p>identify the proper root causes you're</p>
<p>not going to be addressing the correct</p>
<p>problem now items to the right basically</p>
<p>you know is the rest of our process here</p>
<p>you know we we identify now that we know</p>
<p>the root causes any of the leading</p>
<p>indicators what data sources we need to</p>
<p>integrate with and then you know</p>
<p>Associated recommendations with that so</p>
<p>um today though we are going to be</p>
<p>focusing on uh the root cause review so</p>
<p>we wanted to bring this uh blueprint</p>
<p>essentially to make available to people</p>
<p>because uh basically we have you know</p>
<p>implemented solutions for clients we now</p>
<p>are enabling you know clients and you</p>
<p>know even new clients right to utilize</p>
<p>our um root cause analysis application</p>
<p>to identify you know what kind of root</p>
<p>root causes are creating potential you</p>
<p>know downtime availability losses</p>
<p>anything like that you can utilize our</p>
<p>platform to create solutions to address</p>
<p>these</p>
<p>issues the XM ba XM Pro based rot cause</p>
<p>analysis</p>
<p>application so now I'm going to take you</p>
<p>through the</p>
<p>actual um the actual demo uh and you can</p>
<p>see kind of what we've provided in terms</p>
<p>of a a</p>
<p>blueprint second I</p>
<p>bring all right so we have here um the</p>
<p>demo so I'll quickly go through the</p>
<p>basic pieces of this landing page so</p>
<p>you'll land here the first part is uh</p>
<p>the left the number of failures per AET</p>
<p>type for the last 12 months months so</p>
<p>this is based off um ISO 224 which is</p>
<p>actually the structure that we've</p>
<p>utilized uh to create our um our</p>
<p>variation of the</p>
<p>fivey uh the iso code basically goes</p>
<p>over how to capture data in a quote</p>
<p>unquote like reliability format you know</p>
<p>to ensure when you're doing an analysis</p>
<p>you know later in the year everything's</p>
<p>captured into you know appropriate</p>
<p>categories so you can analyze in the</p>
<p>future uh this is is used across</p>
<p>multiple uh</p>
<p>manufacturing uh facilities as well as</p>
<p>you know different equipment types so</p>
<p>here for our sample right we have a</p>
<p>centrifugal pumps we have the broad</p>
<p>categories for failure mechanisms as</p>
<p>electrical failures external influences</p>
<p>material failures and mechanical</p>
<p>failures now coming on to the right card</p>
<p>action items due soon so this is at a</p>
<p>high level everything that you or all</p>
<p>the rcas that you've created</p>
<p>all the actions that are due so you know</p>
<p>this is great if you need to look up you</p>
<p>know potentially one that you have been</p>
<p>assigned to you know double checking</p>
<p>which ones you have and when they're due</p>
<p>or at a high level perhaps you know</p>
<p>maintenance manager looking at all the</p>
<p>associated action items that need to be</p>
<p>due and you doing any sort of necessary</p>
<p>followup finally we get to the bottom</p>
<p>card here the all root CA analysis card</p>
<p>so this uh this card allows you to</p>
<p>actually go through and um look back at</p>
<p>your for existing root cause analysis</p>
<p>look at any pending action item just</p>
<p>look at any of the timelines anything</p>
<p>like that once they're completed they</p>
<p>will be stored here so again for</p>
<p>documentation purposes you can reference</p>
<p>them in the</p>
<p>future so right now we're going to go</p>
<p>through and create uh a new RCA so you</p>
<p>can just see the general</p>
<p>process so first uh as mentioned in the</p>
<p>PowerPoint the failure details so we</p>
<p>just want to capture it high level first</p>
<p>of all what has happened and the</p>
<p>associated Financial impact right that's</p>
<p>the most important thing um you know you</p>
<p>typically do root cause analysis for you</p>
<p>know extremely high impact things you</p>
<p>know that you need to address um so for</p>
<p>this demo we have uh centrifugal pumps</p>
<p>uh as the as the asset type now going</p>
<p>forward you can add any Associated asset</p>
<p>types that you want so if you've got</p>
<p>Heat exchangers fans anything of that</p>
<p>nature you can add a structure in there</p>
<p>uh to add them just to your um RCA</p>
<p>application I'm going to go ahead and</p>
<p>just copy and paste some of this data in</p>
<p>so you don't have to watch me uh watch</p>
<p>me type here so we have a asset ID</p>
<p>equipment ID and what basically happen</p>
<p>so there was a pump and it was shut down</p>
<p>due to a high overall vibration in the</p>
<p>de bearing so this happen uh the</p>
<p>beginning of the month we're now trying</p>
<p>to evaluate it while everything is fresh</p>
<p>facility so uh this client is based out</p>
<p>of this fictional client is based out of</p>
<p>Texas and they have basically two areas</p>
<p>um of their facility in terms of safety</p>
<p>impact there was no safety impact a bit</p>
<p>of operational impact and a large uh</p>
<p>larger production impact</p>
<p>here so after completion of all these</p>
<p>fields it will automatically sum up</p>
<p>double check all your items here and you</p>
<p>can click save and continue oh apologies</p>
<p>I did not add a zero there there is some</p>
<p>validation on these fields these fields</p>
<p>are required so you do need to fill them</p>
<p>all in this is all necessary</p>
<p>information going on to our next phase</p>
<p>um timeline so this is the data you know</p>
<p>collection portion that's really you</p>
<p>know vital to your uh your cause mapping</p>
<p>right you need to identify all the</p>
<p>associated events that could have per U</p>
<p>that could have cumulated accumulated in</p>
<p>your failure now if you also notice up</p>
<p>here there are associated breadcrumbs</p>
<p>this provides additional navigation</p>
<p>between the pages as well as let I mean</p>
<p>let your team know essentially that this</p>
<p>is how many parts you still have to do</p>
<p>to complete your</p>
<p>RCA so coming back to um you have your</p>
<p>cross-sectional team basically available</p>
<p>and they're digging through and they've</p>
<p>noticed</p>
<p>that uh way back in June right we we</p>
<p>installed a new</p>
<p>assembly um and this was of normal um</p>
<p>normal maintenance there was an overhaul</p>
<p>and we just uh we installed a new</p>
<p>rebuilt assembly</p>
<p>here um digging through your cmms</p>
<p>records you notice that</p>
<p>unfortunately</p>
<p>um unfortunately here there was a</p>
<p>failure and it was all Hands-On deck the</p>
<p>failure of a fan and unfortunately a</p>
<p>scheduled TM was not completed so this</p>
<p>was for lubrication of that U of that</p>
<p>home uh now a couple days later there is</p>
<p>also a scheduled uh vibration route</p>
<p>that's done um it does not pick up any</p>
<p>sort of anomalous uh overall vibration</p>
<p>yet right maybe you know the bearing is</p>
<p>still okay at this point now</p>
<p>unfortunately</p>
<p>these these um lubrication PMs and B</p>
<p>routes they only happen every couple of</p>
<p>months right so everything looks to be</p>
<p>okay until an operator basically comes</p>
<p>up um and he's doing his normal routes</p>
<p>and he can he can hear something wrong</p>
<p>with this bearing um at that point it's</p>
<p>too late right uh your your bearing's</p>
<p>probably your bearing's probably done</p>
<p>what he does is he he tells his manager</p>
<p>um and his manager basically calls up um</p>
<p>the Rel liability and maintenance team</p>
<p>and they take another reading um</p>
<p>basically before the scheduled reading</p>
<p>basically on the day that it's taken</p>
<p>down the vibe comes and says look this</p>
<p>is a stage forbearing failure at this</p>
<p>point you need to shut it down I have no</p>
<p>idea when it's going to fail and we</p>
<p>don't want to just have a random</p>
<p>unplanned uh downtime in the middle of</p>
<p>the night when there's no</p>
<p>support so um your cross-sectional team</p>
<p>has basically gone through and put</p>
<p>together the series of events uh they</p>
<p>think you know this is good enough but</p>
<p>we think we have an idea now of what</p>
<p>could be what would have caused this</p>
<p>issue now we still need to capture</p>
<p>everyone that has participated so you</p>
<p>know obviously for documentation</p>
<p>purposes you want to capture everyone</p>
<p>that um is part of this first of all we</p>
<p>have uh Bob CA Bob Costa is a process</p>
<p>engineer we also want to</p>
<p>cap</p>
<p>well um you want to capture this for</p>
<p>documentation purposes but you also want</p>
<p>to ensure um that everyone here is</p>
<p>captured because when</p>
<p>you uh assign the action items uh you</p>
<p>can only assign the action items for</p>
<p>people that were captured here so again</p>
<p>you want to make sure everyone is</p>
<p>captured here so we next have Jill Smith</p>
<p>she's a reliability engineer she also</p>
<p>works at</p>
<p>company last but not least we have uh</p>
<p>Max berson he is the maintenance team</p>
<p>lead so he has provided his input into</p>
<p>this RCA and he is</p>
<p>Robson</p>
<p>comp.com okay so now we have our</p>
<p>participants now we have our timelines</p>
<p>um you know we want to go ahead and uh</p>
<p>save and</p>
<p>continue um as we go to this part</p>
<p>someone says oh you know I think I need</p>
<p>to revise part of my timeline okay so we</p>
<p>go back uh via the breadcrumbs here and</p>
<p>he says you know I want to make it clear</p>
<p>that my operator he informed me ASAP and</p>
<p>we tried to get this done as as soon as</p>
<p>possible so we want to add a an</p>
<p>additional note here it says um you know</p>
<p>operator</p>
<p>notified integer</p>
<p>immediately</p>
<p>well</p>
<p>okay so uh there is a couple additional</p>
<p>functions here one of them is the save</p>
<p>button so you can see the save button is</p>
<p>to the top right of each card if you do</p>
<p>need to make modifications you can go go</p>
<p>ahead and do so after a certain point in</p>
<p>the RCA you'll no longer be able to make</p>
<p>modifications right for documentation</p>
<p>purposes people can't just come back and</p>
<p>continually make modifications but at</p>
<p>this point right you haven't done the C</p>
<p>map you can make modifications you can</p>
<p>also delete and I don't necessarily want</p>
<p>to delete here but if you click here and</p>
<p>click delete you can you know delete</p>
<p>anything maybe um you're doing a</p>
<p>revision with your team and you decide</p>
<p>oh this event actually didn't happen or</p>
<p>you know potentially we need to shift</p>
<p>around some things you can go ahead and</p>
<p>delete and upload you know the necessary</p>
<p>information but we're going to go ahead</p>
<p>and save and</p>
<p>continue but coming onto the failure</p>
<p>analysis part right so this is the most</p>
<p>important part right ensuring that you</p>
<p>you capture the correct failure analysis</p>
<p>as well as you know identifying the root</p>
<p>cause so you can have corrective actions</p>
<p>to take so what failure mechanism so</p>
<p>again uh utilizing</p>
<p>14224 the iso code right there is highle</p>
<p>buckets that we want to place</p>
<p>again for documentation purposes in the</p>
<p>future so this uh overall vibration you</p>
<p>know causing uh bearing failure that</p>
<p>would typically be considered a</p>
<p>mechanical</p>
<p>failure H what kind of mechanical</p>
<p>failure was this well you know it was</p>
<p>related to specifically vibration and</p>
<p>why did this happen so what caused um</p>
<p>you know what did the vibration do</p>
<p>essentially to kill the pump and in this</p>
<p>case uh it created a bearing failure and</p>
<p>um the bearing failure was eventally</p>
<p>going to um freeze up the pump and the</p>
<p>pump was going to stop stop rotating so</p>
<p>after this part you're you're saying</p>
<p>okay so the failure mechanism which is</p>
<p>you know at the highest level what you</p>
<p>you you visibly see is that the bearing</p>
<p>failure due to vibration caused the pump</p>
<p>to fail now what kind of uh comments or</p>
<p>additional information can you</p>
<p>provide you go through and look at um</p>
<p>your system maybe your Vibe system and</p>
<p>you know you analys that and analyze</p>
<p>that data and you find that um you know</p>
<p>like in your timeline that these these</p>
<p>bearing uh readings indicated a stage</p>
<p>for failure and then um there was</p>
<p>indication of bpfo so basically at this</p>
<p>point your Vibe Tech is recommended</p>
<p>please you know shut down again we don't</p>
<p>want unplanned um</p>
<p>outages again this is kind of like the</p>
<p>higher level what you actually see now</p>
<p>we come down to the actual um failure</p>
<p>causes right so you know the bearing you</p>
<p>know um unless there was a manufacturing</p>
<p>defect right the bearing just doesn't</p>
<p>fail by itself it has it has some help</p>
<p>here right so in terms of um what we've</p>
<p>dug in through the timeline basically it</p>
<p>looks like a PM was missed and um don't</p>
<p>know if it's like within the system if</p>
<p>there's some way to you know ensure the</p>
<p>PM is done but essentially the p m is</p>
<p>missed right so that is kind of failur</p>
<p>to like the management the workflow</p>
<p>system right something something is not</p>
<p>aligning this is a critical piece of</p>
<p>equipment and when the PM is missed we</p>
<p>want to ensure that it is done again</p>
<p>right um we can't just be mying</p>
<p>PM so in terms of that um it's it's sort</p>
<p>of a CMM you know cmms potentially or</p>
<p>documentation error right basically or</p>
<p>you know potentially a management error</p>
<p>depending on on you know which one</p>
<p>you're team um goes for basically so um</p>
<p>you know the management of the PMS needs</p>
<p>to be re-evaluated you need to look at</p>
<p>basically uh how we can ensure that</p>
<p>critical PMS are are completed or</p>
<p>rescheduled you know um if the you know</p>
<p>potentially was done the day after this</p>
<p>may not have been an issue right so um</p>
<p>after you've evaluated with your team</p>
<p>you leave some comments</p>
<p>basically um and apologies um so the</p>
<p>definitely because of this uh unplanned</p>
<p>failure another piece of equipment all</p>
<p>hands were on Deck this PM was missed</p>
<p>and unfortunately because this PM only</p>
<p>happens uh not on a high frequency uh it</p>
<p>was not known until basically the</p>
<p>bearing was in a stage where failure</p>
<p>that was going to um that was going to</p>
<p>cause an unexpected</p>
<p>failure so this is your uh cause map</p>
<p>once you're happy with this you can go</p>
<p>to save and continue</p>
<p>and this is the final stage this is the</p>
<p>action portion so you can see here this</p>
<p>is the cosm that you just created now if</p>
<p>you do need to modify anything you can</p>
<p>go back to the failure analysis tab uh</p>
<p>via the breadcrumbs but right now you</p>
<p>can basically take a look at this um and</p>
<p>identify what sort of actions you need</p>
<p>to take to address this so in this case</p>
<p>um one of the things is that basically</p>
<p>the PM was missed right so we want to</p>
<p>identify why the PM was missed</p>
<p>um and some some notes here</p>
<p>basically because this was missed um we</p>
<p>need to discuss with maintenance how to</p>
<p>mitigate this in the F future I guess</p>
<p>the current practice is basically the PM</p>
<p>is closed and we wait for the next one</p>
<p>to come along but for certain PMS right</p>
<p>especially ones like this that can't be</p>
<p>the current</p>
<p>practice um max berson he is the</p>
<p>maintenance um he is in charge of kind</p>
<p>of assigning the different PMS he can</p>
<p>take a look at how we can potentially</p>
<p>address this in the future we should</p>
<p>probably give him some time right uh</p>
<p>probably at least a month or two right</p>
<p>he needs to go back through double check</p>
<p>double check what the current practice</p>
<p>is and communicate that to his</p>
<p>te next U we're noticing that basically</p>
<p>because there was no Contin continuous</p>
<p>vibration monitoring on this piece of</p>
<p>equipment um it was only picked up</p>
<p>because an operator heard the sounds</p>
<p>right which is that point it's not uh</p>
<p>it's not</p>
<p>savable and so you know we've been</p>
<p>hearing about all these iot sensors</p>
<p>right they they uh they returned</p>
<p>real-time data this could have</p>
<p>potentially caught it before it became a</p>
<p>stage for uh bearing failure why don't</p>
<p>we look into some of these iot sensors</p>
<p>there's a lot on the market right but um</p>
<p>you know based off our process and you</p>
<p>know needed temp requirements and things</p>
<p>like that we can probably find something</p>
<p>that we can install on there and ensure</p>
<p>that we are seeing the vibration data in</p>
<p>real</p>
<p>time so Jill Smith she is a reliability</p>
<p>engineer she's going to go through she's</p>
<p>going to take a look at any sort of</p>
<p>associated um iot sensor companies that</p>
<p>look like they could be a good fit for</p>
<p>our</p>
<p>application all right new</p>
<p>actions so theme is deliberated okay we</p>
<p>feel that these actions are are good um</p>
<p>and are addressing the issues now if we</p>
<p>do need to come back and add actions in</p>
<p>the future can go ahead um if we you</p>
<p>know think about something else or you</p>
<p>know X Y and Z otherwise we feel we feel</p>
<p>confident that this is going to address</p>
<p>this issue so now that you've created</p>
<p>your actions you're going to go ahead</p>
<p>and return</p>
<p>home and now you can see that um these</p>
<p>are um by RCI um you can see that this</p>
<p>one was created</p>
<p>um was created and so now you can go</p>
<p>back and reference that in the</p>
<p>future</p>
<p>all right um so that is the</p>
<p>demonstration again um a couple quick</p>
<p>items to note here so you can navigate</p>
<p>to the rcas Via here um so for example</p>
<p>if you want to see</p>
<p>um see this RCA another sample RCA you</p>
<p>see oh I want to reference like what was</p>
<p>discussed here it might have been a</p>
<p>while you can go back and see based off</p>
<p>the action item the RCA similarly you</p>
<p>can go back and reference the RCA</p>
<p>here oh</p>
<p>is not created it</p>
<p>is let's see this now you can basically</p>
<p>see what the information is that was</p>
<p>captured in that</p>
<p>RCA okay now I'm going to go back over</p>
<p>to Gavin um and he's going to finish out</p>
<p>this uh this</p>
<p>presentation thank you very much uh</p>
<p>Nicole the the one thing I will mention</p>
<p>is this is a blueprint so what that</p>
<p>means is if there's anything extra you</p>
<p>want to change you want to add to you</p>
<p>can adapt this to your own processes you</p>
<p>can change this to to your own way of</p>
<p>doing things um all the data is um</p>
<p>captured if you can go to the next slide</p>
<p>please Nicole all the data is captured</p>
<p>and the the other thing is even if you</p>
<p>flag something is deleted it's not</p>
<p>deleted from the database it's flagged</p>
<p>so you can't actually bring it up</p>
<p>however you can put a ton of metrics on</p>
<p>top of that and actually bring a lot of</p>
<p>that up we will be expanding on the</p>
<p>blueprints as well um and adding a lot</p>
<p>of different feedback options for the</p>
<p>reporting Etc so where can you find it</p>
<p>um it is part of our blueprints</p>
<p>accelerators and patents um we covered</p>
<p>that in a prior webinar what that is how</p>
<p>to access it um on that page if you hit</p>
<p>the landing page bottom right there's an</p>
<p>RSS feed if you click that it'll</p>
<p>actually um give you the RSS feed you</p>
<p>can load into your outlook Etc and then</p>
<p>you can be informed whenever we publish</p>
<p>new ones um out this particular one uh</p>
<p>should be out um just after these</p>
<p>webinars just before the holidays um and</p>
<p>you'll be able to access it uh and and</p>
<p>go from there you can also contribute to</p>
<p>these as well so if you have anything</p>
<p>you feel that you need to contribute uh</p>
<p>please don't be shy next slide</p>
<p>please and with that um thank you Nicole</p>
<p>for uh running us all through that um</p>
<p>this will be uh it for the webinars for</p>
<p>the year so we'll be taking a short</p>
<p>break uh for all the holidays that</p>
<p>everyone's going to go on and we'll be</p>
<p>seeing you in February</p>
<p>2024 um so be safe thank you for the</p>
<p>Fantastic um 2023 for attending feedback</p>
<p>and and comments um and we will pick</p>
<p>this up in February of next year thank</p>
<p>you all thank you</p>
<p>everyone</p>
