<summary>Transcript</summary>unplanned downtime remains a big
<p>challenge for asset intensive Industries</p>
<p>and Facilities that not only limit</p>
<p>output but result in high costs and</p>
<p>unsafe</p>
<p>operations what if you can change from a</p>
<p>reactive way of working to predicting</p>
<p>when and how equipment will fail XM</p>
<p>Pro's model-based predictive maintenance</p>
<p>solution does just that XM Pro's</p>
<p>intelligent digital twin Suite or idts</p>
<p>integrates real-time sensor data with</p>
<p>maintenance and inspection information</p>
<p>in the data stream designer it is in</p>
<p>this workflow where XM Pro can combine</p>
<p>engineering calculations with Advanced</p>
<p>AI to create unique prescriptive</p>
<p>recommendations the app designer is the</p>
<p>command center where your reliability</p>
<p>Engineers maintenance planners and</p>
<p>maintenance managers have real-time</p>
<p>predictions and condition information at</p>
<p>their fingertips to make better</p>
<p>decisions faster imagine overseeing</p>
<p>multiple power facilities such as wind</p>
<p>farms for for</p>
<p>example understanding the health of each</p>
<p>facility at a granular level is</p>
<p>essential to optimize output across the</p>
<p>portfolio of assets with XM Pro idts</p>
<p>each site status asset health is</p>
<p>visually represented with colors</p>
<p>changing based on severity and</p>
<p>likelihood of failure and this isn't</p>
<p>just</p>
<p>Aesthetics it's Vital Information at a</p>
<p>glance with notifications pushed to the</p>
<p>right people when there are predicted</p>
<p>equipment failures let's take a closer</p>
<p>look at what happens at the asset level</p>
<p>in this asset view maintenance planners</p>
<p>and maintenance managers can view alerts</p>
<p>to work requests work requests to work</p>
<p>orders and the time taken to close work</p>
<p>orders from this view maintenance</p>
<p>managers can also see all of the</p>
<p>recommendations for each plant by</p>
<p>severity let's drill down to a specific</p>
<p>asset here is a win turbine with</p>
<p>real-time performance metrics and asset</p>
<p>health</p>
<p>information condition monitoring ident</p>
<p>identifies issues such as low oil level</p>
<p>while anomaly detection looks for</p>
<p>abnormal behavior all of these result in</p>
<p>recommendations that can automatically</p>
<p>be turned into service requests or work</p>
<p>orders or the star of root cause</p>
<p>analysis each recommendation that is</p>
<p>triggered can also include triage</p>
<p>instructions as well as various</p>
<p>analytics relating to this specific</p>
<p>recommendation as well as other</p>
<p>recommendations related to this specific</p>
<p>asset consider a processing plant it's</p>
<p>not just about ensuring that individual</p>
<p>machines are running it's about</p>
<p>maximizing efficiency across a plant</p>
<p>Factory or facility through XM Pro idts</p>
<p>defects and real-time anomalies become</p>
<p>visible allowing rapid intervention</p>
<p>across a portfolio of assets take this</p>
<p>pump for example with our sweet</p>
<p>predictive maintenance solution not only</p>
<p>can you track live data but also</p>
<p>forecast potential issues it can inform</p>
<p>the remaining useful life of the pump</p>
<p>based on a predictive model and it shows</p>
<p>all the contextual maintenance</p>
<p>information to make the best decision on</p>
<p>when to service repair or replace the</p>
<p>asset if you need a better view of your</p>
<p>asset you can utilize interactive 3D</p>
<p>models that can even drill down to the</p>
<p>individual component level in this view</p>
<p>you can easily identify where different</p>
<p>recommendations are being triggered from</p>
<p>XM Pro co-pilot brings the full power of</p>
<p>generative AI to your fingertips</p>
<p>get responses from llm Models such as</p>
<p>chat GPT or even train your model on</p>
<p>your internal data for highly customized</p>
<p>responses now that we have looked at the</p>
<p>app designer let's look at what we do</p>
<p>with all that data that's where the XM</p>
<p>Pro idts recommendation engine shines it</p>
<p>provides actionable datab back</p>
<p>suggestions it's like having a digital</p>
<p>consultant sifting through mountains of</p>
<p>data to offer you the best course of</p>
<p>action now for those most keen on</p>
<p>details our data streams are the</p>
<p>workhorses pulling from diverse data</p>
<p>sources cleaning data applying intricate</p>
<p>analytics and generating insights this</p>
<p>behind the-scenes process is what sets</p>
<p>XM Pro idts apart and for those</p>
