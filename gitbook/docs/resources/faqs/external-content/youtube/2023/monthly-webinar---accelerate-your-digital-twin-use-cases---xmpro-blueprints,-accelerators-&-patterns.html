<summary>Transcript</summary>
<p>hello everybody and welcome to today's</p>
<p>uh webinar my name is Gavin Green I look</p>
<p>after strategic solutions for for exm I</p>
<p>want to thank you all for attending</p>
<p>today uh if you have any questions uh</p>
<p>put them into the uh the chat uh I think</p>
<p>there's question section as well I'll</p>
<p>try and get to them at the end as we go</p>
<p>through it so in today's webinar what</p>
<p>we're going to go through is how to</p>
<p>accelerate your digital twin use cases</p>
<p>using our blueprints accelerators and</p>
<p>pattern as</p>
<p>well before we start though uh we just</p>
<p>need to make sure that we're aligned on</p>
<p>some of the terminology um make sure</p>
<p>that when we're talking um an</p>
<p>accelerator or pattern everyone's on the</p>
<p>same page um on the topic so to do that</p>
<p>U it's easier if I just open it up and</p>
<p>we just go through this so starting from</p>
<p>the bottom um each of these tends to</p>
<p>build on each other so patterns um on</p>
<p>the far right here we see these as</p>
<p>preconfigured data streams we also see</p>
<p>widgets and I'll explain what the</p>
<p>difference is when I go into that uh</p>
<p>form part of the patterns um on on the</p>
<p>right</p>
<p>here the</p>
<p>accelerators um that is typically a</p>
<p>Jupiter notebook from our AI or our</p>
<p>notebook section um it could also be one</p>
<p>or two pages um it could also be a set</p>
<p>of recommendation s with the data Stream</p>
<p>So it builds on the patterns just a</p>
<p>little bit more and then blueprints</p>
<p>blueprints you could see those as</p>
<p>pre-built Solutions so they're typically</p>
<p>around a specific use case um and they</p>
<p>will contain data streams</p>
<p>recommendations um some app</p>
<p>visualizations templates</p>
<p>Etc what are some of the benefits by by</p>
<p>using templates um why are we having</p>
<p>this discussion around blue accelerators</p>
<p>and patterns and what does it mean for</p>
<p>for me and and my organization uh for</p>
<p>for those watching</p>
<p>today so some of the key benefits uh for</p>
<p>this is lower cost of deployment you can</p>
<p>integrate your Silo data um using best</p>
<p>practices you're going to shorten your</p>
<p>time to Value um and that plays into the</p>
<p>next one as well which is improving your</p>
<p>internal personal productivity you don't</p>
<p>have to spend a lot of time working all</p>
<p>the intricate details and and bits some</p>
<p>pieces up you can use this as your</p>
<p>starting platform um and then just adapt</p>
<p>it and change it to your own</p>
<p>requirements as</p>
<p>well you can increase your return on</p>
<p>your value proposition again these all</p>
<p>tie into the shorten time to Value piece</p>
<p>of the top which is really U the key</p>
<p>thing here around all three of them it</p>
<p>doesn't matter if it's a pattern an</p>
<p>accelerator or a blueprint it really is</p>
<p>how do we do things a lot quicker um and</p>
<p>get to our end result a lot faster the</p>
<p>the last one is an</p>
<p>interesting you can get the domain</p>
<p>Knowledge from our partners as well as</p>
<p>ourselves around certain use cases again</p>
<p>you can import these adapt them change</p>
<p>them to your own requirements um but</p>
<p>just some of the benefits of using the</p>
<p>uh the templates</p>
<p>themselves when it comes to our suite of</p>
<p>um products which pieces do these touch</p>
<p>it's going to touch all four them it's</p>
<p>going to touch the data streams the AI</p>
<p>the app designer and also the</p>
<p>recommendation manager as well so it</p>
<p>touches all four of them as you see them</p>
<p>here coming back to my um Iceberg</p>
<p>analogy slide patterns you'll find right</p>
<p>down the bottom here the the patterns</p>
<p>are touching the uh the data stream side</p>
<p>so the DS data wrangling analytics</p>
<p>integration orchestration when we start</p>
<p>talking around the accelerators</p>
<p>accelerators will be touching the AI</p>
<p>piece they could be touching the</p>
<p>recommendation manager piece as well as</p>
<p>the data stream and then you have your</p>
<p>Blueprints and blueprints will go from</p>
<p>the top all the way down whether it's</p>
<p>the app designer recommendations AI or</p>
<p>data streams the notice down the bottom</p>
<p>there the subscription manager we don't</p>
<p>actually touch anything in the</p>
<p>subscription manager for all three of</p>
<p>them so pattern accelerators or or</p>
<p>blueprints the subscription manager is</p>
<p>just where you control your access to</p>
<p>the different pieces so remember when</p>
<p>you're importing and creating your your</p>
<p>different uh blueprints uh or even your</p>
<p>accelerators make sure you set up the</p>
<p>correct access for your team uh if you</p>
<p>want to share them either read access or</p>
<p>write access to them as well if you</p>
<p>don't do that no one else will be able</p>
<p>to use those different components as</p>
<p>well so let's dive into what is it that</p>
<p>we're actually looking at here and and</p>
<p>how do I get a hold of them</p>
<p>if I go into our documentation website</p>
<p>um on the far left you will see there is</p>
<p>a link which says blueprints</p>
<p>accelerators and patents what that will</p>
<p>do is that'll take you to a website this</p>
<p>website is hosted in GitHub itself and</p>
<p>you can see blueprints accelerators and</p>
<p>pattern if we start at the bottom and</p>
<p>work our way all the way to the Top If</p>
<p>we go to patterns it will list all the</p>
<p>different patterns that we have</p>
<p>published now publish these if you wish</p>
<p>to contribute I will have a link right</p>
<p>at the end which will walk us through</p>
<p>how to contribute um and make your own</p>
<p>patterns accelerators or blueprints</p>
<p>available here and you can merge them in</p>
<p>as well pattern is broken up into two</p>
<p>main sections um that I have available</p>
<p>here the AI these will be data streams</p>
<p>and then widgets which will be used in</p>
<p>the app</p>
<p>designer this is a constantly evolving</p>
<p>site as we have new um items added in</p>
<p>either of the three sections they will</p>
<p>be added to these Pages um and you'll be</p>
<p>able to access them as well if you click</p>
<p>the view details on any of them it'll</p>
<p>take you down into the actual component</p>
<p>itself so this is the asset monitoring</p>
<p>using binary classification across the</p>
<p>top you have your visuals so if you</p>
<p>click into those you can actually see</p>
<p>what they look like from the visual</p>
<p>perspective just clicking out of that</p>
<p>will'll close them on the left you will</p>
<p>see all the pages will have a set of</p>
<p>common items the one is going to be the</p>
<p>import password whenever you try and</p>
<p>import anything it doesn't matter if it</p>
<p>is a widget it doesn't matter if it's a</p>
<p>data stream recommendation or an app you</p>
<p>need an import password we use the same</p>
<p>password for all of these items just to</p>
<p>make it easier for people to integrate</p>
<p>um and and use these all you can do is</p>
<p>just double click and copy this</p>
<p>particular password Here</p>
<p>and then you can use it when you're</p>
<p>importing if you're looking for</p>
<p>instructions and how to import you can</p>
<p>click this particular link here it will</p>
<p>take you to our documentation site which</p>
<p>will list out the import export um and</p>
<p>all the different components from our</p>
<p>documentation S as well does not matter</p>
<p>if it's a data stream uh recommendation</p>
<p>Etc it's all on this particular site</p>
<p>here on how to import it'll walk you</p>
<p>through the different details um for</p>
<p>that as well and then lastly there'll be</p>
<p>a file section which will contain the</p>
<p>various components that you are going to</p>
<p>need this particular example has two</p>
<p>there's a SQL script and there's a data</p>
<p>stream if you go and open the script</p>
<p>you'll notice that it'll actually take</p>
<p>you to the uh repository at the back</p>
<p>which has the components that you need</p>
<p>to actually run it so in this example</p>
<p>this would be the SQL script so you can</p>
<p>just copy the actual text here run this</p>
<p>against your SQL environment go back and</p>
<p>now you can and open up the data stream</p>
<p>and again you can just download the</p>
<p>actual data stream to import it as</p>
<p>well it does not matter if this is a</p>
<p>full blueprint and I'll show you a few</p>
<p>examples on that as well it follows the</p>
<p>same principle here with regards to the</p>
<p>section on the left components in the</p>
<p>middle you'll see a table of contents</p>
<p>will allow you to jump around different</p>
<p>items that we're looking at the data</p>
<p>stream will just highlight what are some</p>
<p>of the items that are used used in the</p>
<p>data Stream So if you want to learn a</p>
<p>little bit more you want to get a bit</p>
<p>more comfortable with the particular</p>
<p>pattern in this example which of the</p>
<p>agents are we using and again each of</p>
<p>these will take you and allow you to</p>
<p>drill down into that</p>
<p>particular um documentation and you can</p>
<p>find out more information as as you want</p>
<p>to or or need to right at the bottom are</p>
<p>the typical steps to follow to import it</p>
<p>does not matter if this is again a</p>
<p>package an accelerator or a blueprint</p>
<p>you're going to follow the very similar</p>
<p>steps to import the key thing at the top</p>
<p>there though is making sure that you</p>
<p>have a set of variables defined these</p>
<p>variables are typically create created</p>
<p>when you're installing a site but again</p>
<p>it's just good to make sure that you</p>
<p>have them when you are importing so what</p>
<p>do I mean by by these variables you need</p>
<p>to have specific access and you'll</p>
<p>notice here on the left there is</p>
<p>variables I'm in the app designer right</p>
<p>now I just click the uh hamburger and I</p>
<p>click variables it'll open up the</p>
<p>variables for</p>
<p>me what we're looking for is to make</p>
<p>sure you have the app designer URL and</p>
<p>the app designer integration key you</p>
<p>will notice that there is an app</p>
<p>designer URL inside the app designer and</p>
<p>if we go into the data streams you will</p>
<p>find one in there as well just a</p>
<p>reminder variables are shared so if you</p>
<p>define it in the app designer it'll be</p>
<p>available in the data stream and vice</p>
<p>versa however you do need to apply your</p>
<p>variables in both systems the reason for</p>
<p>that is each of them is using a</p>
<p>different encryption key um specifically</p>
<p>when you are encrypting the values in</p>
<p>here so just keep that in mind when you</p>
<p>are actually creating or confirming the</p>
<p>variables that you set them in both</p>
<p>environments you'll see here in the app</p>
<p>designer I can go down and I can see my</p>
<p>integration key if I go into the data</p>
<p>stream you can see I've set them as well</p>
<p>if you have not set them how do you know</p>
<p>you can see all the items here which</p>
<p>have the Chevron next to them have not</p>
<p>been set in the app designer whereas in</p>
<p>the data stream designer they have been</p>
<p>set so that's how you can very quickly</p>
<p>tell have they' been configured or not</p>
<p>do you need to configure them in both</p>
<p>environments it depends on your use case</p>
<p>and how you're going to use these</p>
<p>particular</p>
<p>variables inside the app designer I'm</p>
<p>not going to be using the actual too or</p>
<p>the ml flow capabilities but inside my</p>
<p>data stream I am that's why they are</p>
<p>configured for me in</p>
<p>here so important across the top make</p>
<p>sure that you have these defined to be</p>
<p>able to use this um data stream in this</p>
<p>example you'll notice that we're talking</p>
<p>around SQL username password down here</p>
<p>the reason we are is a lot of the</p>
<p>accelerators and pattern um are set to</p>
<p>specific data sources that we have</p>
<p>defined now when you are actually</p>
<p>loading in these accelerators by just</p>
<p>open up this particular one that we are</p>
<p>looking at</p>
<p>here you will see in this data stream we</p>
<p>have two items one which is going to be</p>
<p>where's my data coming from but two</p>
<p>where is my context coming from if you</p>
<p>want to change your context you can U</p>
<p>just make sure that over here you</p>
<p>obviously creating the variables to</p>
<p>whatever system you are changing it to</p>
<p>when you load it in so step one is</p>
<p>really just confirming your variables</p>
<p>where are you going to be getting your</p>
<p>data from um to to be able to do</p>
<p>anything the app designer these two here</p>
<p>is required when you are trying to run a</p>
<p>recommendation using a recommendation</p>
<p>manager or you are looking to pass data</p>
<p>to our visuals that is why you've</p>
<p>defined the two of those if you do not</p>
<p>have that def you will not be able to</p>
<p>use these two agents on this particular</p>
<p>data stream</p>
<p>itself second run the SQL script so here</p>
<p>you will see the smart meter again if I</p>
<p>open that up in another window you will</p>
<p>see what it is you actually creating and</p>
<p>configuring again do you have to use</p>
<p>this um in your own environment no by</p>
<p>all means you can swap that piece out</p>
<p>and drag on another context Provider</p>
<p>from the library as you need to or want</p>
<p>to bring it</p>
<p>in second importing the data</p>
<p>stream so first thing that you would</p>
<p>need to do is make sure that you</p>
<p>download the data stream uh from this</p>
<p>particular environment here so you can</p>
<p>see here is the data stream um itself</p>
<p>the extension U uh Fu so here I can just</p>
<p>click the download and it'll download</p>
<p>the actual carile for me to be able to</p>
<p>use</p>
<p>all</p>
<p>next thing we want to import that</p>
<p>particular data string it follows the</p>
<p>same process um if you go into the data</p>
<p>streams you will see there is an import</p>
<p>option if you click that it's going to</p>
<p>ask you for a file key this file key is</p>
<p>this key that we've copied across the</p>
<p>top here which is the input password</p>
<p>again we use the same password for all</p>
<p>three sections just to make it a lot</p>
<p>easier for folks to to use so you just</p>
<p>put the key in there and now you can</p>
<p>actually please select the file to to uh</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>upload and now we can say upload what</p>
<p>this will do is it will check your site</p>
<p>as well and it'll do the same for</p>
<p>recommendations it'll do the same for</p>
<p>for apps um if it picks up that there is</p>
<p>already a version of that it's going to</p>
<p>ask you a question you want to import it</p>
<p>as a new version what you want to import</p>
<p>it is a completely new entity of that</p>
<p>then this one is a data stream so I'm</p>
<p>going to get the option there it'll do</p>
<p>the same for a recommendation it'll do</p>
<p>the same for an app as well if you want</p>
<p>to just say a new version uh it'll just</p>
<p>increment the version and create this</p>
<p>system new version even if that app</p>
<p>recommendation or data stream is</p>
<p>published it'll create a new version but</p>
<p>it's not going to take that version live</p>
<p>you still need to go in and edit it and</p>
<p>change it because this is a data stream</p>
<p>it's going to ask me where do I actually</p>
<p>want to uh run it and I can put it into</p>
<p>the correct collection make sure that</p>
<p>you are following the um the actual</p>
<p>blade itself it's going to ask you</p>
<p>different question depending on what it</p>
<p>is that you want to import for the</p>
<p>different areas if I go into my new data</p>
<p>stream I can give it a name put it in a</p>
<p>category but again I slap my collection</p>
<p>designation um as</p>
<p>well once we've imported that then it is</p>
<p>available for for our use and as I go</p>
<p>into this particular</p>
<p>example</p>
<p>you can now change and configure it so</p>
<p>next step once we've imported it assign</p>
<p>access to others as required again</p>
<p>applies to all the different areas um as</p>
<p>well you need to decide who else is</p>
<p>going to be using this uh with you</p>
<p>because this is the data stream we can</p>
<p>go into the manage access and make sure</p>
<p>you're giving access to the correct</p>
<p>people also Define what type of access</p>
<p>you want to give them you want to give</p>
<p>them read access write access or coowner</p>
<p>access uh to it as well read access will</p>
<p>just allow you to view the co components</p>
<p>and content right will allow you to edit</p>
<p>and co-owner access will typically allow</p>
<p>you to change other people's access</p>
<p>rights to it as well if you have read</p>
<p>access to items you cannot publish or</p>
<p>unpublish uh that component whether it</p>
<p>is a data stream whether it's a</p>
<p>recommendation or whether it's an actual</p>
<p>app itself all you can do is edit and by</p>
<p>edit I mean you can go in and configure</p>
<p>and see what the items are you can make</p>
<p>changes to it it'll give you the little</p>
<p>ascts that will ask you to say but as</p>
<p>soon as you try and save it'll tell you</p>
<p>you do not have access to that and you</p>
<p>will not be able to save it um as</p>
<p>well</p>
<p>important have a look at the different</p>
<p>components that you and this is</p>
<p>specifically important with regards to</p>
<p>the the data streams themselves when</p>
<p>you're importing them you need to make</p>
<p>sure that you double click anything that</p>
<p>that is a exm Pro app and it's correctly</p>
<p>configured to use the URL and the key</p>
<p>the same for the recommendation make</p>
<p>sure that it is correctly set up to use</p>
<p>the uh the key and the uh the URL as</p>
<p>well what you also need to do is make</p>
<p>sure that your context provider is</p>
<p>pointing to whatever data source it is</p>
<p>that you've defined this one is pointing</p>
<p>to the SQL um because we've loaded the</p>
<p>SQL um across the top into there as well</p>
<p>so you need to make sure that that's</p>
<p>been defined as well the recommendation</p>
<p>make sure it's pointing to the correct</p>
<p>URL key just click apply save um and</p>
<p>that should be all you need to do the</p>
<p>entity items um the different components</p>
<p>down here you don't need to remap those</p>
<p>or reset those all you really need to do</p>
<p>is just make sure that your connection</p>
<p>properties are set typically your URL in</p>
<p>your key if I come into the SQL again</p>
<p>make sure that it's pointing to the</p>
<p>correct instances here making sure it's</p>
<p>your correct database your correct and</p>
<p>it'll automatically start filling in the</p>
<p>rest of the items for you as</p>
<p>well and then right at the bottom just</p>
<p>clicking apply publish and ensure that</p>
<p>you are getting data coming through for</p>
<p>for all of these but once you've</p>
<p>configured everything and it is ready to</p>
<p>go make sure you hit publish go to the</p>
<p>live view um and</p>
<p>typically pick the uh the item before</p>
<p>the Run recommendation as well as the</p>
<p>the app so here you'll see predict is</p>
<p>the the item coming out the AI post</p>
<p>elemetry is coming out of the action</p>
<p>agent depending on the data stream that</p>
<p>you've configured it'll take a bit um</p>
<p>just to run this one's running a</p>
<p>predictive model loading a lot of data</p>
<p>and contextual data so it'll take a</p>
<p>little bit of time to come through make</p>
<p>sure you've got the data flowing through</p>
<p>this particular section here before you</p>
<p>continue onwards I.E going in loading an</p>
<p>app loading a recommendation</p>
<p>Etc you can see the data is coming</p>
<p>through now across the top which means</p>
<p>we've configured this correctly and we</p>
<p>can either leave it running um and</p>
<p>continue on to the next step or we can</p>
<p>unpublish it depending on what the use</p>
<p>case for this item</p>
<p>is</p>
<p>accelerators if I go into into the top</p>
<p>we'll tend to build on patterns but</p>
<p>before we go into accelerators there's</p>
<p>this another area on P which is around</p>
<p>widgets now what a widget is is it is</p>
<p>into the realm of the app designer and</p>
<p>it really is how do I create individual</p>
<p>components that I don't have to spend a</p>
<p>lot of time trying to move everything</p>
<p>Pixel Perfect uh for it so what we've</p>
<p>done here is we've curated a list of a</p>
<p>lot of different widgets that we tend to</p>
<p>reuse over and over again just to make</p>
<p>it quicker and easier for folks to</p>
<p>actually use inside the app designer</p>
<p>again it's going to follow the same</p>
<p>principle across the top you will have</p>
<p>your um visuals these visuals here you</p>
<p>will see uh this is what the actual run</p>
<p>space will look like there is the</p>
<p>configure space um as well because this</p>
<p>is inside the app designer there's two</p>
<p>themes there's a light theme and a dark</p>
<p>theme on the left you have your same</p>
<p>thing which is importing the password as</p>
<p>well as a file as well as a widget so if</p>
<p>I open up that particular widget you'll</p>
<p>see it will take me again back into the</p>
<p>uh GitHub repo and it'll allow me to</p>
<p>download those particular um files</p>
<p>themselves so where are these uh widgets</p>
<p>and and how do I use them inside the app</p>
<p>designer if I go into a particular</p>
<p>application so I'm going to go into my</p>
<p>one example here if you go into the edit</p>
<p>mode as if you were configuring a</p>
<p>particular app</p>
<p>itself on this particular area here here</p>
<p>you'll see under blocks on the left</p>
<p>there's a widget section you have two</p>
<p>icons here which will allow you to</p>
<p>export a widget or import a widget if</p>
<p>you tell it you want to</p>
<p>import it's going to ask you for a key</p>
<p>this is the same key that we've got</p>
<p>across the top that is what we're</p>
<p>interested in so you paste the key there</p>
<p>and then you upload the actual widget</p>
<p>file itself that you are interested in</p>
<p>all of the widgets have a file that will</p>
<p>allow you to import that particular</p>
<p>widget so the depending on what it is</p>
<p>that you are looking to actually use and</p>
<p>reuse in your applications you just load</p>
<p>the appropriate widget for that where</p>
<p>the widgets actually appear is if you</p>
<p>expand</p>
<p>the the accordion you'll see all your</p>
<p>widgets will appear here as</p>
<p>well if I drag one on you will notice</p>
<p>that it will drag the item in for me as</p>
<p>well most of the widgets that we</p>
<p>configure will be from a Content card</p>
<p>perspective so you'll see here we have</p>
<p>card and here is a Content card that</p>
<p>will actually drag it in if I drag in</p>
<p>the other one you'll see this one is</p>
<p>dynamic and this one is</p>
<p>static why do we have two of these items</p>
<p>depending on your use case the one on</p>
<p>the right here means I have a static</p>
<p>view it's not going to change um I'm</p>
<p>only going to have so many columns you</p>
<p>can now come in and change as you want</p>
<p>to or need to so if you are not</p>
<p>interested in having all the columns you</p>
<p>can come in and actually remove a column</p>
<p>now I've only got three</p>
<p>columns each of these if you click on an</p>
<p>item and go to page layers you will</p>
<p>notice that there is typically a data</p>
<p>source that's been defined in the page</p>
<p>layer themselves so if I click the data</p>
<p>source it will allow me to bind this to</p>
<p>a particular data source itself so here</p>
<p>I can go into the page data create</p>
<p>myself a u data source typically</p>
<p>pointing to a data stream and if I go to</p>
<p>the block properties I can actually bind</p>
<p>this this particular data source um to</p>
<p>it and now I can come in and start</p>
<p>binding as I would normally the actual</p>
<p>text to any of the properties coming in</p>
<p>from that particular data source</p>
<p>itself all the widgets function in a</p>
<p>very similar faction where anything that</p>
<p>has data sources will allow you to map</p>
<p>them and move them as well again this is</p>
<p>a static this one's a little bit more</p>
<p>Dynamic what that means is you'll notice</p>
<p>this section here we've only to find one</p>
<p>the data source is going to dictate how</p>
<p>many columns it's actually going to be</p>
<p>creating for me and you'll find this</p>
<p>pattern follows through in a lot of the</p>
<p>actual widgets themselves there will</p>
<p>typically be a static one but there will</p>
<p>also be a dynamic one whether it's</p>
<p>columns or rows which will allow you to</p>
<p>grow um the actual um app pieces itself</p>
<p>if I click in here and go to the page</p>
<p>layers you'll see there is the total</p>
<p>data source and there is the child data</p>
<p>source so this is typically where you</p>
<p>would put the data source um itself and</p>
<p>then you just map the items and then</p>
<p>it'll configure everything for you I</p>
<p>mentioned two themes the widgets unless</p>
<p>otherwise specified will function in</p>
<p>both themes themselves so if I go into</p>
<p>the dark theme and I drag these two</p>
<p>widgets in as well you will notice that</p>
<p>they will be colored appropriately um</p>
<p>and they will match that particular</p>
<p>theme itself so if I go and actually</p>
<p>launch this you can see there are my um</p>
<p>items if I go to my live theme there are</p>
<p>my items as well because I bound this</p>
<p>one to the data source you will notice</p>
<p>that it's actually going to duplicate</p>
<p>the items so let's go in there let's</p>
<p>remove the data source for the uh the</p>
<p>moment and we can then have a look</p>
<p>at how this is actually rendering so</p>
<p>this is what it would look like in the</p>
<p>live theme this is what it would look</p>
<p>like in the dark</p>
<p>I didn't have to change anything um I</p>
<p>didn't have to edit anything I can just</p>
<p>drag them on use them and configure them</p>
<p>as I need to and that follows the same</p>
<p>for pretty much all the widgets um in</p>
<p>here and there's a lot of different</p>
<p>widgets um in here um this list is</p>
<p>constantly being added to we're</p>
<p>constantly growing it um if you have</p>
<p>something that you feel You' like to put</p>
<p>in here by all means send it to send it</p>
<p>in or contribute it um as well um to</p>
<p>this particular list the last it I'll</p>
<p>touch on is blueprints so inside</p>
<p>blueprints we're building on the other</p>
<p>two um items themselves so pattern</p>
<p>typically you have your um data streams</p>
<p>and widgets inside accelerators you will</p>
<p>see here these are typically onepage</p>
<p>apps so this one here would be um I've</p>
<p>just got a visual which is just showing</p>
<p>me 3D items and how do I bind them to a</p>
<p>Unity view so there is an app over here</p>
<p>and there is a data stream again it'll</p>
<p>walk you through what are some of the</p>
<p>key pieces in it but the steps you'll</p>
<p>notice is very similar to what we've uh</p>
<p>just gone through with the the patent</p>
<p>confirming your variables importing what</p>
<p>you need to do importing the application</p>
<p>um and then just running it from from</p>
<p>there inside the accelerators there is</p>
<p>an AI section as well so here if I open</p>
<p>this up we'll load the um quick start</p>
<p>guide or um our Jupiter notebooks or our</p>
<p>notebooks ourselves any of the other U</p>
<p>notebooks that we make available will</p>
<p>appear in here as well and we'll</p>
<p>function under the</p>
<p>accelerator coming into blueprints</p>
<p>you'll notice they just keep building on</p>
<p>each other here so the blueprints</p>
<p>themselves if I go into a particular</p>
<p>example in here across the top you have</p>
<p>your visuals again you can click through</p>
<p>that and see what all the different</p>
<p>components are in that um blueprint</p>
<p>itself on the left you just just have a</p>
<p>lot more items to</p>
<p>import you still got the same</p>
<p>instruction you still have the same</p>
<p>password here you have your application</p>
<p>and template there are the</p>
<p>recommendations data stream and any um</p>
<p>data scripts that are needed same</p>
<p>principle applies here when you are</p>
<p>importing your data streams you can</p>
<p>adjust and change where your data is</p>
<p>coming from you can also adjust and</p>
<p>change your recommendations so if the</p>
<p>thresholds are not to your liking change</p>
<p>and adjust them as well you'll see same</p>
<p>pattern make sure your variables are</p>
<p>defined running any of your scripts U</p>
<p>that need to be run there is a sequence</p>
<p>to importing a</p>
<p>blueprint um typically you will import</p>
<p>your data streams then you'll import</p>
<p>your</p>
<p>recommendations uh there are times when</p>
<p>you may be importing a second data</p>
<p>stream in between the two especially if</p>
<p>it's working on a recommendation that</p>
<p>will be called out in the actual steps</p>
<p>themselves and then last you'll import</p>
<p>your application for it when you're</p>
<p>importing your application you'll notice</p>
<p>down here it'll call out specific steps</p>
<p>that you need to do this is when you're</p>
<p>linking to</p>
<p>recommendations um and where you need to</p>
<p>do that the reason for doing application</p>
<p>last is if you were to do application</p>
<p>first one of the options on an import is</p>
<p>going to ask you to bind it to the</p>
<p>different data streams if you've not</p>
<p>imported those data streams left you can</p>
<p>leave it blank but you're going to have</p>
<p>to go and manually set that up</p>
<p>afterwards that's why the application is</p>
<p>typically lost because you already</p>
<p>imported your data streams you've</p>
<p>imported your recommendations and you</p>
<p>should just be able to match everything</p>
<p>when you import it it makes the</p>
<p>experience a lot quicker and a lot more</p>
<p>pleasant when you are loading those</p>
<p>in if we come back to to the items um</p>
<p>that we've got here again there's three</p>
<p>areas that typically build on top of</p>
<p>each other patents accelerators and and</p>
<p>blueprints so how do I contribute and</p>
<p>where do I get access uh to these so for</p>
<p>contributions um the link across the top</p>
<p>that QR code will take you straight to</p>
<p>that particular link itself or for</p>
<p>direct access you can click that link at</p>
<p>the bottom as well um if you don't want</p>
<p>to remember those particular links what</p>
<p>you can do is just go to our</p>
<p>documentation website documentation.</p>
<p>xo.com click the uh the link on the left</p>
<p>and it'll take you to that website as</p>
<p>well perfect um while I keep this up</p>
<p>here let's see if we've got any</p>
<p>questions from from anyone on the</p>
<p>audience we do okay so the one question</p>
<p>here is is around contrib okay so if you</p>
<p>want to contribute there's two ways you</p>
<p>can contribute um to it uh if you're not</p>
<p>comfortable loading them into the</p>
<p>repository or where to put it or how to</p>
<p>style it by all means you can send it to</p>
<p>us whether it's a pattern an accelerator</p>
<p>or blueprint what we'll do is um load it</p>
<p>ourselves and give you the um correct</p>
<p>attributes as to where it came from to</p>
<p>to load it in there if you are more</p>
<p>comfortable uh what you can do is you</p>
<p>can Fork the repository uh check it in</p>
<p>and then we can actually merge that in</p>
<p>uh once it's been rated and checked and</p>
<p>then it'll be available for everyone</p>
<p>else to to load in as</p>
<p>well next steps uh just before we wrap</p>
<p>up here um to remember to to register</p>
<p>for next month's webinar again there's</p>
<p>two options for it um here we'll be</p>
<p>hosting a a hoty Q&amp;A session around</p>
<p>predictive maintenance and continue uh</p>
<p>condition monitoring as well any</p>
<p>questions you can reach out to our um or</p>
<p>our team for more information and again</p>
<p>thank you all for attending today have a</p>
<p>great rest of uh rest of your day</p>
