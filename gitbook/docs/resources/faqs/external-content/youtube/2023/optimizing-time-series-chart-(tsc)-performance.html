<p>{% embed url=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm5plue7P2A&quot; %}</p>
<p>In this walkthrough, we explore the key improvements we've made to enhance the performance and scalability of Time Series Chart (TSC), one of our most utilized data visualization tools. We'll discuss the challenges with handling large volumes of data, and how our specialized TSC connectors alleviate these issues.</p>
<p>Key Highlights: Traditional TSC performance pitfalls with high-volume data sets. Introduction to specialized TSC connectors that efficiently handle large volumes of data. Demo of the new TSC SQL connector's performance metrics. Agenda: Problem Statement: Discussion on how traditional TSC design struggles with handling large data volumes, leading to slow data return and processing times.</p>
<p>Solution Overview: Introduction to our specialized TSC connector, designed to return only the data points actually displayed on the chart. This ensures faster data retrieval and client-side processing.</p>
<p>Technical Deep Dive: Elaboration on how the specialized TSC connector works in conjunction with the block to crunch the numbers and deliver optimized performance.</p>
<p>Demo: A live demonstration by Dragon, our expert developer, showcasing the new TSC SQL connector in action.</p>
<p>Upcoming Releases: Information on future compatibility with Azure Data Explorer and Historian, and what you will need for the block enhancement in 4.3 release.</p>
<p>User Experience: Pros and cons of using the new approach, including its impact on user interactions like zooming and changing asset selection.</p>
<p>Additional Notes: The functionality will be rolled out for Azure Data Explorer and Historian in subsequent releases. Smaller data volumes can continue to use original connectors to avoid load between interactions. Relevant Metrics: Data request returned in less than 400 milliseconds. Reduced data size to 44-45 KB. Join us as we delve into these innovative changes aimed to make your experience with Time Series Charts smoother, quicker, and more scalable.</p>

<p>application designers time series chart</p>
<p>or TSC is one of our most popular data</p>
<p>visualizations</p>
<p>however we found that performance is not</p>
<p>satisfactory with large volumes of data</p>
<p>and as you know this is usually the case</p>
<p>with time series data</p>
<p>all relevant data is returned to the</p>
<p>client for processing so that it doesn't</p>
<p>need to be refreshed</p>
<p>unless certain parameters are changed</p>
<p>but large volumes of data are slow to</p>
<p>return and slow to process on the client</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>we've made changes to the block itself</p>
<p>and released a specialized TSC connector</p>
<p>that only Returns the data points</p>
<p>displayed on that chart</p>
<p>the block sends the requested parameters</p>
<p>to the connector which retrieves the</p>
<p>data from the data source crunches the</p>
<p>numbers and sends back only the data</p>
<p>actually displayed</p>
<p>for example rather than sending 60 000</p>
<p>records for 180 buckets we're only</p>
<p>returning 180 records</p>
<p>this results in a fast and scalable user</p>
<p>experience</p>
<p>the disadvantage of this approach is</p>
<p>that it is repeated every time the chart</p>
<p>is interacted with such as zooming or</p>
<p>changing the asset selection</p>
<p>a CSC SQL connector is available now</p>
<p>and the functionality will be rolled out</p>
<p>for Azure data Explorer and historian</p>
<p>next</p>
<p>you will need the 4.3 release for The</p>
<p>Block enhancement and thereafter simply</p>
<p>load the new connectors as they are made</p>
<p>available</p>
<p>alternatively you can continue using the</p>
<p>original connectors for smaller data</p>
<p>volumes to avoid the load between</p>
<p>interactions</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>have a demo by Dragon another one of our</p>
<p>talented developers of the new connector</p>
<p>in action</p>
<p>we discovered doing a trial run through</p>
<p>that my audio is not going to play or</p>
<p>the audio of the video is not going to</p>
<p>play through from you so</p>
<p>this is my first run through with the</p>
<p>script so let's just see how that goes</p>
<p>when we play the video</p>
<p>this is the new TSC SQL connector</p>
<p>which pulling the selected fields that</p>
<p>we have for this time range</p>
<p>and this interval size</p>
<p>we can see that the request was</p>
<p>returning in less than 400 milliseconds</p>
<p>and the size is 44 45 kilobytes</p>
<p>if I open the request now we can see</p>
<p>that we have 179 records or buckets and</p>
<p>for each packet we have the selected</p>
<p>field with their corresponding Min and</p>
<p>Max values that are actually showing on</p>
<p>this one</p>
<p>now what we've said is if we move the</p>
<p>range it's going to send a new request</p>
<p>the same size in the same time</p>
<p>if we move the range</p>
<p>sorry if we increase or decrease the</p>
<p>interval size we should have double the</p>
<p>buckets</p>
