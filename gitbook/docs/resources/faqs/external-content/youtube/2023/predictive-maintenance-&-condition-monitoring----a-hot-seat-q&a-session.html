<summary>Transcript</summary>
<p>hello everybody and welcome to another</p>
<p>webinar from uh from exen Pro um my name</p>
<p>Gavin Green I look after strategic</p>
<p>solutions for exen pro and today I've</p>
<p>got Timothy White uh one of our</p>
<p>engineering Consultants uh with us today</p>
<p>so what are we going to cover into</p>
<p>today's session uh let's just build this</p>
<p>up so condition monitoring predictive</p>
<p>maintenance um essential for optimizing</p>
<p>equipment performance</p>
<p>reducing cost improving safety when you</p>
<p>start bringing in uh digital twins into</p>
<p>that um you can amplify some of these</p>
<p>benefits today's format of our webinar</p>
<p>is going to be a little bit different uh</p>
<p>not just us presenting information uh to</p>
<p>to the users um and demos Etc what we're</p>
<p>actually going to do is we're going to</p>
<p>do going to go through a few discussion</p>
<p>points specifically around condition</p>
<p>monitoring predictive maintenance uh</p>
<p>from an engineer's perspective um so</p>
<p>let's Dive Right In to that Tim do you</p>
<p>want to just give us a quick intro to</p>
<p>yourself please sure thanks Kevin uh</p>
<p>yeah I um I've done three years as a</p>
<p>reliability engineer in both process and</p>
<p>open pit and now I work as a software</p>
<p>consultant engineering consultant for XM</p>
<p>Pro perfect and also uh heavily involved</p>
<p>and and leading different projects so</p>
<p>Weir nutrient or a few of them as well</p>
<p>um and very active and he keeps pressing</p>
<p>us around process Improvement Etc so uh</p>
<p>very very very big advocate for that</p>
<p>Insight some of the topics that we're</p>
<p>going to cover um so fundamentals of</p>
<p>condition monitoring predictive uh we</p>
<p>have to start with a baseline where are</p>
<p>we coming from and then move from there</p>
<p>we're then going to go into Data</p>
<p>integration uh and</p>
<p>simulation um bringing in some realtime</p>
<p>data and iot integration we then going</p>
<p>to touch on some imp mation challenges</p>
<p>uh some of the data analytics and then</p>
<p>some best practices in predictive</p>
<p>maintenance um as well before we go into</p>
<p>these topic areas though um it's always</p>
<p>good to to just make sure that we have</p>
<p>some uh alignment on ter terminology so</p>
<p>we're all talking the same and we're not</p>
<p>talking past each other so just some of</p>
<p>the the common terms so when we're</p>
<p>talking around condition monitoring</p>
<p>we're talking around the the process to</p>
<p>continuously Monitor and assess perform</p>
<p>perance and health of Machinery um to</p>
<p>detect issues and prevent unplanned</p>
<p>downtime when we're talking about</p>
<p>predictive maintenance uh we're talking</p>
<p>about a proactive approach using data</p>
<p>analytics machine learning to predict</p>
<p>equipment failures so that we can</p>
<p>perform timely maintenance uh of them as</p>
<p>well and then the third prescriptive</p>
<p>maintenance um again using data</p>
<p>analytics machine learning this one</p>
<p>recommends specific actions and optimal</p>
<p>timing for maintenance tasks um to to</p>
<p>maximize reliability and minimize</p>
<p>downtime the terminology around a</p>
<p>digital twin So exm Pro is part of the</p>
<p>digital twin Consortium um the</p>
<p>definition uh from the Consortium does</p>
<p>not include the modelbased uh item that</p>
<p>we've got there um however we feel that</p>
<p>is uh it is part of the definition so</p>
<p>when we're talking digital twins we're</p>
<p>talking around a model-based virtual</p>
<p>representation of World entities and</p>
<p>processes synchronized at a specific</p>
<p>frequency and Fidelity we're going to</p>
<p>talk around digital twins as we go</p>
<p>through and and how that links into</p>
<p>condition monitoring predictive Etc but</p>
<p>just to make sure we're all on the same</p>
<p>Baseline what is it that we're talking</p>
<p>around and um the uh the common</p>
<p>definitions to to build from um as</p>
<p>well so let us move straight in</p>
<p>um to the first topic so so we're going</p>
<p>to put you in the hot seat uh hot seat</p>
<p>here Tim so to speak so the first area</p>
<p>that we're going to chat around is the</p>
<p>fundamentals of condition monitoring and</p>
<p>predictive maintenance so I've got a few</p>
<p>questions on the side here um we're not</p>
<p>going to bring the questions up be happy</p>
<p>to share with them after the webinar as</p>
<p>well so the first one companies looking</p>
<p>to to implement uh predictive</p>
<p>maintenance solution they often tell me</p>
<p>they're not ready for it um they don't</p>
<p>know where to start this is probably not</p>
<p>a fit for them how do you approach these</p>
<p>types of discussions with them that's uh</p>
<p>a really good question you have to</p>
<p>convince people also to spend money and</p>
<p>open the pur strings um so in in</p>
<p>reliability there's uh there's a</p>
<p>maintenance hierarchy that's typically</p>
<p>based on program maturity um we start</p>
<p>out at reactive preventative condition</p>
<p>based and predictive and prescriptive</p>
<p>you kind of touched on it a little bit</p>
<p>earlier uh I would say that company that</p>
<p>tries to do everything all at once is</p>
<p>going to waste quite a bit of money and</p>
<p>ruin any Goodwill that the reliability</p>
<p>group has generated with maintenance and</p>
<p>operations uh nobody starts with</p>
<p>prescriptive maintenance without quite a</p>
<p>bit of pre-work they start small with</p>
<p>condition-based monitoring and then move</p>
<p>into a PDM program um following that</p>
<p>maintenance hierarchy I would advise</p>
<p>this company to start with CD CBM or</p>
<p>condition-based monitoring and then move</p>
<p>to prescriptive and predictive modeling</p>
<p>uh as applicable based on asset</p>
<p>criticality okay okay now I do like that</p>
<p>um the fact that there is a hierarchy</p>
<p>there um and there there's there's steps</p>
<p>to to get to it so people don't just</p>
<p>jump into predictor maintenance from the</p>
<p>GetGo with nothing there's a few puddles</p>
<p>as we call them to to go through to to</p>
<p>actually get them um turning a little</p>
<p>bit though um how does condition</p>
<p>monitoring and predictive maintenance</p>
<p>benefit from bringing in and integrating</p>
<p>digital Twins and event intelligent</p>
<p>platforms into</p>
<p>that um that is a good question I I'll</p>
<p>start out with what uh an event</p>
<p>intelligence platform is um an event</p>
<p>intelligence</p>
<p>platform uh helps analyze data collected</p>
<p>from a variety of sources including</p>
<p>digital twins uh they help identify</p>
<p>patterns Trends uh anomal</p>
<p>IES um they can significantly help PDM</p>
<p>and condition monitoring reliability</p>
<p>groups by giving uh near real-time</p>
<p>alerts um to operation</p>
<p>staff uh using machine learning models</p>
<p>to detect deviations of sensors and</p>
<p>processes um they call it decision</p>
<p>support uh prescriptive</p>
<p>analytics um what that means is when a</p>
<p>certain predefined event criteria is</p>
<p>generated a uh alert or warning with</p>
<p>specific instructions on how to fix the</p>
<p>issue or mitigate the issue is also</p>
<p>generated in response to that uh they're</p>
<p>also incredibly useful for historical</p>
<p>data analysis</p>
<p>um I guess moving on to digital twins uh</p>
<p>they ideally ref reflect the current</p>
<p>condition of the physical</p>
<p>counterart uh this integration allows</p>
<p>for reliability teams to uh give</p>
<p>maintenance groups the ability to</p>
<p>visualize the uh they call it the life</p>
<p>cycle of a system and a controlled</p>
<p>environment um meaning from install to</p>
<p>failure they can model it with enough</p>
<p>data um reliability Engineers on that</p>
<p>note uh they can predict failures using</p>
<p>real-time data uh there's there's a</p>
<p>concept in reliability called the</p>
<p>potential for failure curve um based on</p>
<p>St statistical modeling you can put a</p>
<p>particular asset uh at a likelihood of</p>
<p>failure um planners can optimize</p>
<p>maintenance schedules basing rotation</p>
<p>off of condition rather than just time</p>
<p>and then uh on the more mature side data</p>
<p>scientists can test uh input scenarios</p>
<p>and improve designs through machine</p>
<p>learning</p>
<p>simulations um integrating digital Twins</p>
<p>and inet intelligence the I the most</p>
<p>important part is the the learning curve</p>
<p>is significantly shortened um you you</p>
<p>codify the uh experienced operator</p>
<p>intuition and</p>
<p>knowledge okay quite a bit to unpack</p>
<p>there um if we move into Data</p>
<p>integration and and</p>
<p>simulation so we've we've gone</p>
<p>through how do we get to condition</p>
<p>monitoring or predictive or prescriptive</p>
<p>of um the role the digital twin can</p>
<p>bring into that why it's</p>
<p>beneficial for all this to work</p>
<p>though data integration and simulation</p>
<p>going to play a key piece so what role</p>
<p>does data integration and</p>
<p>simulation play in condition monitoring</p>
<p>and predictive</p>
<p>maintenance uh a big one</p>
<p>so yeah uh data integration and</p>
<p>simulations play I call them crucial</p>
<p>roles in predictive maintenance and</p>
<p>condition monitoring uh especially</p>
<p>combined with digital Twins and event</p>
<p>intelligence platforms it's it's the</p>
<p>building</p>
<p>block uh focusing on data integration</p>
<p>first um just to make sure everyone's on</p>
<p>the same page it refers to the process</p>
<p>of combining data from multiple sources</p>
<p>into a single unified view um</p>
<p>consolidation of historical and</p>
<p>real-time data means merging historical</p>
<p>data with operational data patterns and</p>
<p>Trends can be more accurately</p>
<p>identified um it's it's your work order</p>
<p>history it's your shift notes it's your</p>
<p>vibration data in one</p>
<p>display um ideally with uh with regards</p>
<p>to simulation for condition monitoring</p>
<p>it uses computational models and machine</p>
<p>learning and and the more advanced</p>
<p>programs they they de to Ai and tensor</p>
<p>flow and things like that but it the</p>
<p>with the goal the main goal is to</p>
<p>imitate operations of real or processes</p>
<p>and systems um simulation allows for</p>
<p>testing the predictive model and uh</p>
<p>ensuring they're accurate before</p>
<p>applying them to actual equipment and</p>
<p>operations um lowrisk testing for V uh</p>
<p>variables scenario planning also helps</p>
<p>understanding how different conditions</p>
<p>might affect the system um game theing</p>
<p>better preparation and response</p>
<p>strategies uh lastly simulation provides</p>
<p>uh a virtual environment for training</p>
<p>operators and</p>
<p>technicians uh you you remove the risk</p>
<p>of actually damaging equipment and also</p>
<p>giving the operator an intuition without</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>risk together I guess data integration</p>
<p>and simulation they support creation of</p>
<p>a holistic</p>
<p>all-encompassing proactive maintenance</p>
<p>strategy um better decision- making they</p>
<p>provide detailed insights into equipment</p>
<p>Health under various conditions um</p>
<p>thereby I guess the the end result is</p>
<p>reducing downtime and extending life of</p>
<p>uh the</p>
<p>asset so is it also safe to say that uh</p>
<p>um from a data integration perspective</p>
<p>by combining all these different data</p>
<p>sources together um it allows for more</p>
<p>complex analysis which helps the</p>
<p>accuracy of these predicted results so</p>
<p>these two tend to work hand in hand yeah</p>
<p>yeah absolutely it's it's the building</p>
<p>block perfect perfect okay um so with</p>
<p>that being said though and the</p>
<p>criticality of the two of these and and</p>
<p>how they all work together um what</p>
<p>challenges exist in integrating some of</p>
<p>these data</p>
<p>sources uh quite a few um I guess one of</p>
<p>the biggest ones is uh call them data</p>
<p>silos so um different departments</p>
<p>different</p>
<p>organizations uh they have their own</p>
<p>systems and ways of doing things that uh</p>
<p>don't communicate very well with each</p>
<p>other and they can hinder that uh</p>
<p>unified view of data that a digital twin</p>
<p>requires um for example uh truck liner</p>
<p>bed thicknesses are on an Excel document</p>
<p>on one computer and fuel records are on</p>
<p>an Excel document and another computer</p>
<p>um both are useful to digital twins but</p>
<p>they aren't useful in their card format</p>
<p>and need to be exposed to the digital</p>
<p>twin um data quality and consistency is</p>
<p>another big one uh ensuring data is</p>
<p>accurate and up to dat and consistent</p>
<p>across the various sources is crucial um</p>
<p>because you're relying on that for</p>
<p>decision support poor data quality can</p>
<p>lead to incorrect analysis and faulty</p>
<p>predictions um complexity of integration</p>
<p>the data silos kind of touched on it but</p>
<p>um multiple data sources in Legacy</p>
<p>systems typically don't talk very well</p>
<p>with each</p>
<p>other um real-time data processing it's</p>
<p>it's costly it's expensive in in time</p>
<p>and money uh the ability to process</p>
<p>realtime data is challenging um but it's</p>
<p>also essential for timely decision</p>
<p>making for your PM groups operations</p>
<p>groups um scalability is another big one</p>
<p>uh the system must be able to scale with</p>
<p>growth and data and simulations without</p>
<p>also growing in latency nobody wants to</p>
<p>work on a slow system</p>
<p>um models in simulation</p>
<p>require</p>
<p>uh computational resources and the the</p>
<p>better the model uh or the excuse me the</p>
<p>I guess um models require High Fidelity</p>
<p>so the the better models require more</p>
<p>data and that's challenging without</p>
<p>continuous refinement and validation</p>
<p>outcomes and I touched on computational</p>
<p>resources the the more simulations you</p>
<p>run</p>
<p>um the more computationally intensive it</p>
<p>gets um cyber security is a big one as</p>
<p>we've all seen uh you're putting all of</p>
<p>your data in one bread basket and making</p>
<p>it a much bigger Target so cyber</p>
<p>security for everyone working is</p>
<p>incredibly</p>
<p>important um expertise in in digital</p>
<p>Twins and in reliability you you have to</p>
<p>be able to speak across departments for</p>
<p>both both the data scientists and the uh</p>
<p>reliability</p>
<p>folks um and we spoke on cost change</p>
<p>management is also a big one uh</p>
<p>workforces are generally resistant</p>
<p>anytime you have a technology like</p>
<p>digital Twins or event intelligence</p>
<p>machine learning um how the how the</p>
<p>software is rolled out and who's</p>
<p>involved and who has a stake in it can</p>
<p>make or break the program</p>
<p>um and then Regulatory Compliance as</p>
<p>well uh ensuring data handling and</p>
<p>processing comply with relevant</p>
<p>regulations whether it be socks or some</p>
<p>other regulation that I'm not aware of</p>
<p>um especially in industries that are</p>
<p>heavily</p>
<p>regulated uh addressing challenges</p>
<p>addressing the challenges requires</p>
<p>combination of strategic planning and</p>
<p>investment in technology and training</p>
<p>nobody's just going to happen upon it</p>
<p>and then development of new processes</p>
<p>and government or governance models for</p>
<p>data okay so there quite a few there's</p>
<p>quite a few there to unpack um if we if</p>
<p>we just focus on the the realtime um</p>
<p>aspect of this so real-time data because</p>
<p>you you alluded to it earlier around um</p>
<p>passing real-time data to the models uh</p>
<p>Etc so in in your experience what are</p>
<p>the biggest challenges and</p>
<p>opportunities when inter integrating iot</p>
<p>devices with intelligent digital twins</p>
<p>um specifically for realtime monitoring</p>
<p>in predictive maintenance condition</p>
<p>monitoring</p>
<p>Etc uh integrating iot devices presents</p>
<p>quite a few challenges into the um</p>
<p>digital twin uh one of the biggest ones</p>
<p>is data volume and management every iot</p>
<p>sensor you have um depending on the</p>
<p>uptake um generates quite a bit of data</p>
<p>and managing it can be it it needs</p>
<p>expertise if it everybody's dealt with a</p>
<p>system that isn't designed well um we've</p>
<p>talked about complex uh complexity of</p>
<p>integration but it's important so I'm</p>
<p>gonna repeat it uh it's iot systems</p>
<p>generally don't talk to each other so um</p>
<p>you need somebody that can go back and</p>
<p>forth between uh sensor compatibility</p>
<p>quality and connectivity is huge uh that</p>
<p>an accurate and expensive iot sensor</p>
<p>doesn't function without a reliable and</p>
<p>secure wireless network and guess the</p>
<p>other side of the coin</p>
<p>is uh there's no point to having a</p>
<p>reliable and secure network if the data</p>
<p>you're sending over it is inconsistent</p>
<p>and not</p>
<p>reliable interoperability of sensor</p>
<p>systems is big does your vibration</p>
<p>monitor also allow you to integrate uh</p>
<p>temperature</p>
<p>sensor</p>
<p>um regarding the change management side</p>
<p>of it and hesitancy to adopt new</p>
<p>technologies kind of along the same vein</p>
<p>nobody wants to go to five different</p>
<p>websites to interact with five different</p>
<p>sensor</p>
<p>types um I'm sure everybody's been in</p>
<p>that situation too uh lat latency and</p>
<p>skill of ility we we we talked about</p>
<p>latency a little bit but uh we need</p>
<p>asset views to load quickly regardless</p>
<p>of how many sensors or similar systems</p>
<p>exist and then maintenance um</p>
<p>maintenance of the digital twin is</p>
<p>crucial uh depending on size and</p>
<p>complexity they normally require subject</p>
<p>matter experts to maintain and modify</p>
<p>the uh hmis or human machine interfaces</p>
<p>but just like any other system you have</p>
<p>to maintain it uh that being said the</p>
<p>the rewards for a good integration are I</p>
<p>like to think they're exponential um the</p>
<p>pre-work done for one required for One</p>
<p>sensor is the same pre-work design for</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>sensors um data silos are somewhat</p>
<p>mitigated using</p>
<p>pipelines um exposing data making it</p>
<p>more easily</p>
<p>digestible uh it improves asset</p>
<p>performance through that proactive</p>
<p>maintenance strategy we talked about</p>
<p>prescriptive maintenance and then uh</p>
<p>economies of scale um the fixed cost for</p>
<p>sensor implementation becomes much more</p>
<p>palatable the more sensors you have</p>
<p>attack so that fixed cost per goes</p>
<p>down um and then transparency is Big so</p>
<p>all the stakeholders whether it be it or</p>
<p>reliability or maintenance or operations</p>
<p>are all working off the a common set of</p>
<p>data and then a short and learning curve</p>
<p>so the uh optimal State Intuition or</p>
<p>plant intuition the 20-year plant</p>
<p>operator has um can be codified into</p>
<p>that digital twin and that's why it's so</p>
<p>important to have that buy in from these</p>
<p>operators and mechanics that have been</p>
<p>it since I was in college um but yeah uh</p>
<p>another reward is automated decision</p>
<p>making um with the right integration</p>
<p>systems can automatically adjust</p>
<p>processes uh in response to data from</p>
<p>iot devices without hum uh human</p>
<p>intervention and then um safety</p>
<p>it it's a iot censor can exist in an</p>
<p>environment where a person can't U so</p>
<p>there absolutely</p>
<p>necessary um operational efficiencies</p>
<p>are improved when uh equipment is</p>
<p>operating at optimal levels everything</p>
<p>likes to run in steady state and that's</p>
<p>aided by iot</p>
<p>um addressing the challenges involves uh</p>
<p>crossplatform mix of technological</p>
<p>solutions strategic planning and ongoing</p>
<p>management it's not fire and forget</p>
<p>um yeah and then opportunities but</p>
<p>interesting um can you share a success</p>
<p>story uh where iot</p>
<p>integration um with a digital twin has</p>
<p>significantly</p>
<p>improved um either condition monitoring</p>
<p>or predictive maintenance</p>
<p>outcome uh yeah it and this also goes to</p>
<p>show how easily this stuff can be</p>
<p>integrated into your system um so a</p>
<p>while back</p>
<p>when uh I was working in</p>
<p>reliability we had a cone crusher that</p>
<p>would get packed in during Implement</p>
<p>weather uh the cone would bounce um once</p>
<p>that dirt gets packed in it becomes</p>
<p>basically cement and as the crusher</p>
<p>spins around it hops and if you can</p>
<p>imagine uh a 50 ton block of iron</p>
<p>hopping the uh wear and tear on it was</p>
<p>pretty tremendous it would sh shake the</p>
<p>entire building frame so obviously that</p>
<p>was not a desired outcome um the</p>
<p>vibration monitors on the cone crusher</p>
<p>were internal to it um so they could be</p>
<p>changed unless the cone crusher was shut</p>
<p>down so a operator came to me with the</p>
<p>idea to um use a Raspberry Pi and a</p>
<p>microphone</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>uh create a decel meter that wrote to</p>
<p>our</p>
<p>historian um so with a little bit of</p>
<p>python code and a Wi-Fi signal we we</p>
<p>created a proof of concept sensor that</p>
<p>uh fed directly into the control room</p>
<p>HMI and it worked in um backing up the</p>
<p>vibration monitors and sometimes um</p>
<p>replacing them whenever they went down</p>
<p>so um yeah worked out well and it was</p>
<p>cheap</p>
<p>uh cheap cheap uh in the grander scheme</p>
<p>of things yeah cheap in at</p>
<p>work okay so you've touched on some of</p>
<p>uh some of the items there um focusing</p>
<p>on implementation and and data um</p>
<p>analytics um what are some of the</p>
<p>implementation challeng implementation</p>
<p>challenges um of a predictive uh</p>
<p>maintenance solution when involving</p>
<p>digital</p>
<p>terms uh sure the the implement</p>
<p>challenges um for a digital twin for PDM</p>
<p>um they're call it multifaceted uh they</p>
<p>involve Technical Resources from it they</p>
<p>involve advice from reliability groups</p>
<p>operational resources and like I was</p>
<p>talking about those 20-year mechanics</p>
<p>and operators to provide advice in that</p>
<p>Common Sense</p>
<p>check um integrating with existing</p>
<p>systems we we sort of touched on on the</p>
<p>data stream designer earlier but this is</p>
<p>where it proves its worth uh for that</p>
<p>cone crusher example I was able to</p>
<p>perform the task without a lot of</p>
<p>pre-work because uh someone had built a</p>
<p>python library to access our historian</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>rewrite um without that library and</p>
<p>connection to the API it would have been</p>
<p>pretty much impossible at my current</p>
<p>skill level um the data stream designer</p>
<p>has quite a few options for interacting</p>
<p>with uh historians apis databases um</p>
<p>makes the barrier to entry much lower</p>
<p>when the API already</p>
<p>written um another uh challenge is data</p>
<p>collection and quality uh your model is</p>
<p>only as good as the sensors and the</p>
<p>people who help create it um some assets</p>
<p>need sophisticated sensors and some</p>
<p>don't take for instance a a redundant</p>
<p>pump you don't need to throw prescripted</p>
<p>maintenance and machine learning models</p>
<p>and everything like that if it's a $100</p>
<p>replacement and it's got a</p>
<p>redundancy um so you have to weigh asset</p>
<p>criticality as well</p>
<p>as ability and then uh it's this is a</p>
<p>this is a big one it delves into change</p>
<p>management a little bit it's absolutely</p>
<p>necessary that your IT personnel and</p>
<p>your data scientists at least have uh a</p>
<p>rudimentary understanding of the goals</p>
<p>behind a PDM digital twin and uh the</p>
<p>other side of that coin is your PDM</p>
<p>group has to be able to communicate</p>
<p>their needs to the data scientist team</p>
<p>the IT</p>
<p>team um model development validation and</p>
<p>maintenance is also another big</p>
<p>challenge um like I said before digital</p>
<p>twins aren't fire and</p>
<p>forget uh in addition to the regular</p>
<p>maintenance required by any software you</p>
<p>also have to consider business needs of</p>
<p>the plant change over time and the</p>
<p>digital twin has to evolve and grow uh</p>
<p>with the</p>
<p>operation oh go ahead you you touched on</p>
<p>it earlier and you touched on a little</p>
<p>bit here as well um so data analytics</p>
<p>and machine</p>
<p>learning how would they enhance some of</p>
<p>the predictive</p>
<p>capabilities uh data analytics and</p>
<p>machine learning for the more mature</p>
<p>programs um they are designed inherently</p>
<p>to detect patterns in data</p>
<p>sets um whether through supervised</p>
<p>learning or unsupervised</p>
<p>learning pattern recognition is what</p>
<p>they were designed for finding hidden</p>
<p>correlations um they also help in</p>
<p>anomaly of abnormal operating</p>
<p>parameters um predictive</p>
<p>maintenance uh excuse me predicted</p>
<p>modeling um what happens if I change X</p>
<p>and How likely is it going to be to</p>
<p>happen</p>
<p>um for optimizing maintenance schedules</p>
<p>and life cycle management um for example</p>
<p>you take a truck engine or a hall truck</p>
<p>engine uh life cycle can be 20,000 hours</p>
<p>or 40,000 hours depending on condition</p>
<p>and when you're</p>
<p>talking um a million and a half $2</p>
<p>million for an engine replacement it can</p>
<p>definitely affect the bottom line of a</p>
<p>company changing on condition rather</p>
<p>than</p>
<p>time root cause analysis is another one</p>
<p>um aided by anomaly detection and then</p>
<p>the findings of the root cause can then</p>
<p>be fed back into the digital twin to uh</p>
<p>enhance the prescriptive aspect of it</p>
<p>okay and enance decision making and</p>
<p>resource allocation</p>
<p>um clear analysis of data helps support</p>
<p>decision making and prioritizing</p>
<p>maintenance</p>
<p>activities perfect moving on to our last</p>
<p>uh section in our uh our last question</p>
<p>here just keeping an our time for the</p>
<p>folks as well is can you highlight some</p>
<p>best practices um in condition</p>
<p>monitoring and predictive</p>
<p>maintenance sure um some of the best</p>
<p>practices involve you you have to have a</p>
<p>strategy to start off with um clear</p>
<p>goals clear</p>
<p>objectives uh also you have to select</p>
<p>the appropriate</p>
<p>assets not every asset needs</p>
<p>prescriptive analytics like I was</p>
<p>talking about um integrate data</p>
<p>sources operational maintenance records</p>
<p>sensor data and environmental data were</p>
<p>available uh invest in quality</p>
<p>sensors use data analytics and machine</p>
<p>learning where applicable to helped prct</p>
<p>failure um ensure real-time</p>
<p>monitoring regularly update the machine</p>
<p>learning models to reflect current state</p>
<p>uh train staff create a feedback</p>
<p>loop um and most importantly communicate</p>
<p>effectively across departments for um</p>
<p>visibility</p>
<p>sake okay you you touched on a few</p>
<p>interesting ones there um so from an XM</p>
<p>Pro perspective um we follow some of</p>
<p>those best practices ourselves so how do</p>
<p>we how do we actually do that um the</p>
<p>first You' mentioned so identifying and</p>
<p>prioritizing Bad actors two predicting</p>
<p>in real time using a hybrid approach so</p>
<p>how do we bring in some of the you've</p>
<p>touched on condition monitoring</p>
<p>predictive prescriptive so how from a</p>
<p>hybrid approach can you bring some of</p>
<p>those pieces in there as well and then</p>
<p>the last piece is uh a quick time to</p>
<p>Value um for this um and that's aided</p>
<p>with our blueprints templates um Etc as</p>
<p>as</p>
<p>well I'd like to thank you uh thank you</p>
<p>Tim thank you for the time running</p>
<p>through this being being sitting in the</p>
<p>hot seat there so to speak U answering</p>
<p>the questions and things uh put to you</p>
<p>thank you all for uh listening and</p>
<p>attending as well um our our next</p>
<p>webinar next month um again there's two</p>
<p>options for you to attend uh from timing</p>
<p>perspective uh what we're going to do is</p>
<p>go through uh root cause analysis</p>
<p>application so we actually have a</p>
<p>blueprint for that as well how you</p>
<p>capture the recommendations value impact</p>
<p>Etc and as always if you've got any</p>
<p>questions feedback um we just want to</p>
<p>contact us for more information right at</p>
<p>the bottom there just send us an email</p>
<p>and we'll be happy to uh uh to provide</p>
<p>whatever it is uh you're looking for so</p>
<p>again Tim thank you for your time uh and</p>
<p>everyone else thank you for uh attending</p>
<p>today</p>
