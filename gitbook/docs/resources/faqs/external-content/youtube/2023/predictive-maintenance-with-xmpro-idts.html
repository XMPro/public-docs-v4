<summary>Transcript</summary>
<p>in our overview of a video we describe</p>
<p>the process that we followed to get from</p>
<p>our assets and real-time data from the</p>
<p>assets through to some actions and</p>
<p>recommendations that we want to drive</p>
<p>and the outcomes that we're looking for</p>
<p>now the typical process is that we bring</p>
<p>in data through our data stream designer</p>
<p>you could then run some analytics</p>
<p>through AI or do some of it inside the</p>
<p>data stream designer see the front end</p>
<p>in the app designer and then lastly have</p>
<p>recommendations and manage</p>
<p>recommendations inside the</p>
<p>recommendation manager from a</p>
<p>demonstration point of view I'm going to</p>
<p>start at the app designer and then we'll</p>
<p>go into that also includes</p>
<p>recommendations we'll go into the data</p>
<p>stream designer and show you how we do</p>
<p>it in the uh behind the scenes how do we</p>
<p>get the data in and also touch on how we</p>
<p>apply AI to this so let's jump in and</p>
<p>get started</p>
<p>this is the app designer the green icons</p>
<p>at the top</p>
<p>this is the data stream designer and</p>
<p>this is AI so we'll go through all three</p>
<p>of those but I'm going to start kind of</p>
<p>at the end I'm going to show you the</p>
<p>result of what what you see when you use</p>
<p>XM Pro and I'll start with uh just a a</p>
<p>simple example around multiple</p>
<p>facilities or assets that we have in</p>
<p>this instance I'm just I've set the</p>
<p>filter just to show me</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>some of my</p>
<p>Wind forms and I can the colors and</p>
<p>things will change based on the severity</p>
<p>the health of the overall Farm not</p>
<p>necessarily the individual ones I can</p>
<p>set that up to so that I can actually</p>
<p>drill down and get into the actual form</p>
<p>itself and drill down right down you'll</p>
<p>see this is a viewport that is using</p>
<p>esri I'll touch a little bit later on</p>
<p>how we can edit this and what all the</p>
<p>different types of viewports that we</p>
<p>support but this is an example of</p>
<p>something like that here I can see some</p>
<p>of the assets that need maintenance</p>
<p>there's also some recommendations on</p>
<p>some of this so at a holistic view as a</p>
<p>maintenance manager facility manager I</p>
<p>can very quickly see the health and</p>
<p>status of my different facilities and</p>
<p>where I need to go now this again is a</p>
<p>specific type you can have a much more</p>
<p>sophisticated example of this as well</p>
<p>I'll um I'll go into and just show you</p>
<p>again as a maintenance manager</p>
<p>maintenance planner looking at all the</p>
<p>facilities that we have</p>
<p>um I can see kind of the alerts to work</p>
<p>requests work requests to work orders</p>
<p>work orders to open work orders to to</p>
<p>closed and how long it takes to actually</p>
<p>resolve it and</p>
<p>um how what is the efficiency how many</p>
<p>open work orders do I have and what are</p>
<p>the recommendations around all the</p>
<p>different machines again this is</p>
<p>everyone's you'll see there's a whole</p>
<p>bunch</p>
<p>listed through here so and they range in</p>
<p>severity in this instance they rank by</p>
<p>severity</p>
<p>I can look at</p>
<p>the different installations or</p>
<p>facilities that I have and in this</p>
<p>facility this is a wind turbine facility</p>
<p>this is a solar array so</p>
<p>I'll go into the wind turbine one so</p>
<p>I'll have a quick look at what's</p>
<p>happening at the wind turbine and this</p>
<p>gives you an idea and I'll share a more</p>
<p>advanced example of this but I can see</p>
<p>some safety and health information I can</p>
<p>see the overall time usage profile</p>
<p>current metrics that it's running some</p>
<p>of the and again</p>
<p>maintenance records maintenance</p>
<p>information some of the corrosion damage</p>
<p>tables and depending on the type of</p>
<p>modeling that you use I can get into it</p>
<p>you can see this updates in real time if</p>
<p>it's a Unity or Omniverse or a a more</p>
<p>interactive model or a card based model</p>
<p>I can actually get into it and I'll show</p>
<p>you an example of one of those but this</p>
<p>is</p>
<p>with this I can now actually get to a</p>
<p>recommendation so I can see there's low</p>
<p>gearbox oil on this reported and there's</p>
<p>the instance of that that triggered that</p>
<p>so there's a rule that runs and when it</p>
<p>goes below a certain threshold this is</p>
<p>very simple rule around a certain</p>
<p>threshold on the on the on the gearbox</p>
<p>oil low warning and there's potentially</p>
<p>some triage instructions this one</p>
<p>doesn't have too much I can also see how</p>
<p>many times this has occurred and if I</p>
<p>look at kind of a longer duration what</p>
<p>are all the other things that are</p>
<p>happening to this specific asset that</p>
<p>has happened over time I could create a</p>
<p>form or I can fill in a form right here</p>
<p>and this could be a work order request</p>
<p>this could be a root cause analysis a</p>
<p>failure mode analysis</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you can associate</p>
<p>a large number of different act action</p>
<p>forms do this in terms of the kind of</p>
<p>action that you want to take I can also</p>
<p>Mark this as a false positive so that</p>
<p>later on we can start analyzing how many</p>
<p>times are we getting this kind of false</p>
<p>positives out of this so this is one</p>
<p>example of a</p>
<p>facility predictive maintenance I'll</p>
<p>show you a slightly more advanced</p>
<p>example in in this example this is a</p>
<p>processing plant in this instance plant</p>
<p>but it could be a Water Filtration plant</p>
<p>it could be</p>
<p>any processed plant and in that</p>
<p>again analyzing the data looking at</p>
<p>real-time anomalies and looking at</p>
<p>defects where certain type of defects</p>
<p>that are that are happening so this is</p>
<p>on the quality side so I could bring in</p>
<p>some of the process information</p>
<p>there's fill rates efficiency on on the</p>
<p>energy consumption but likewise with</p>
<p>that esri map where I had a</p>
<p>um uh Green Dot or radar or whatever</p>
<p>represent that there's an issue you can</p>
<p>actually see on this one that</p>
<p>there's a there's an issue here so these</p>
<p>will appear or disappear depending on</p>
<p>the recommendations and the current</p>
<p>state so it's very quick to see as a</p>
<p>planner</p>
<p>or maintenance supervisor maintenance</p>
<p>manager plant manager you know what is</p>
<p>happening and I can have a very simple</p>
<p>2D model of a pump with some real-time</p>
<p>data coming through for the pump from</p>
<p>sensors that we have I can see the</p>
<p>nameplate data for the pump</p>
<p>what is writing at or what it's writed</p>
<p>at so just very quickly I can see how</p>
<p>far is it off in terms of its actual</p>
<p>performance I might be running a</p>
<p>predictive model which again will touch</p>
<p>on a little bit later a predictive model</p>
<p>that's pretty predicting the the</p>
<p>remaining is for life</p>
<p>so that I can determine how much time I</p>
<p>have before there I may have an issue</p>
<p>again I can get into the recommendation</p>
<p>in a minute but here's a bunch of</p>
<p>real-time data and around temperatures</p>
<p>vibrations</p>
<p>and all the maintenance records so I can</p>
<p>see maintenance schedules maintenance</p>
<p>history</p>
<p>and I can see what is currently planned</p>
<p>I can also see what has been what has</p>
<p>been recently completed in terms of work</p>
<p>order history really just helps with</p>
<p>um and again I could drill down on this</p>
<p>next level before we do that what I'd</p>
<p>like to do though is actually get a</p>
<p>better view of this type of pump and</p>
<p>if you if if for certain type of</p>
<p>equipment you may want to</p>
<p>expand the capabilities and being able</p>
<p>to see you know what is really happening</p>
<p>so if I look at the discharge exception</p>
<p>or the remaining useful life on the</p>
<p>bearings</p>
<p>I can move this around and actually have</p>
<p>a view on that now</p>
<p>if I click on this view more you'll see</p>
<p>I get to that same recommendation that I</p>
<p>complete but before I go there this was</p>
<p>a discharge exception and I may want to</p>
<p>go to something like cha GPT or</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>generative AI large language models and</p>
<p>actually ask it and I've typed this in</p>
<p>before so that's why it comes up but I</p>
<p>can actually ask it top five root causes</p>
<p>for centrifugal pump where there's a</p>
<p>loss in discharge pressure</p>
<p>and what it does it gives me just some</p>
<p>direction and what I could potentially</p>
<p>do with this</p>
<p>is just copy that</p>
<p>so that when I do go to the the the</p>
<p>recommendation itself</p>
<p>I can kind of create a bit of a starting</p>
<p>point in terms of you know where we</p>
<p>should potentially be looking for</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>for certain issues or and again it's the</p>
<p>same and this again this is a work order</p>
<p>request but it could be root cause</p>
<p>analysis could be different types of</p>
<p>forms that you want to associate with</p>
<p>associate with it this could be have</p>
<p>more advanced triage instructions so you</p>
<p>know these are the typical things that</p>
<p>you could look for Block suction by</p>
<p>blocked impellers</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>it's not necessarily the information</p>
<p>that you send right through to the work</p>
<p>order level it might just be something</p>
<p>for you to help triage what is the</p>
<p>potential issue based on the combination</p>
<p>of this as well as the drills</p>
<p>instructions that we have here and again</p>
<p>the analytics across this to say well</p>
<p>you know I want to know what are all the</p>
<p>issues that we've seen on this pump</p>
<p>lately is it a kind of recurring pattern</p>
<p>or what is happening so that's a key</p>
<p>application for us around</p>
<p>predictive maintenance in facilities</p>
<p>to be able to and condition monitoring</p>
<p>is to be able to get a view of the</p>
<p>um the overall acid and then being able</p>
<p>to get down right into a recommendation</p>
<p>I'll show you how we set up the</p>
<p>recommendation data in a minute but</p>
<p>before we do that I would like to show</p>
<p>you how we do the back end data that</p>
<p>goes into this</p>
<p>now</p>
<p>for that pump we'll just go to the smart</p>
<p>asset that bump that I just showed you</p>
<p>there are two different data streams</p>
<p>here we refer to these as data streams</p>
<p>so they're streaming real-time data this</p>
<p>is a very simple condition monitoring</p>
<p>and then I will also show you a little</p>
<p>bit more then and bonds predictive</p>
<p>maintenance example this is using Azure</p>
<p>digital twin as an example it doesn't</p>
<p>have to be but it uses Azure digital</p>
<p>twin as the digital twin repository or</p>
<p>the the</p>
<p>asset master or the asset model for for</p>
<p>this it could be any existing eam or</p>
<p>other system that you that you have</p>
<p>what we have here is we're getting</p>
<p>real-time pump Telemetry using mqtt</p>
<p>which is a protocol so I'm getting</p>
<p>real-time data in I clean up that data</p>
<p>because industrial data is never clean</p>
<p>and in this instance I just I take this</p>
<p>and I send it to go and update my Azure</p>
<p>data Explorer which will give me a</p>
<p>really nice time series visualization of</p>
<p>all the information that I can drill</p>
<p>down on that and do thumb series slice</p>
<p>and dice</p>
<p>uh information but I can also</p>
<p>do some calculations around the pump</p>
<p>efficiencies and you know all the pump</p>
<p>metrics that we are trying to calculate</p>
<p>and update that state to Azure digital</p>
<p>twin so that we have the lightest on</p>
<p>that I also take that same data and I</p>
<p>will</p>
<p>I run it through to the recommendations</p>
<p>but before I do that I will</p>
<p>contextualize it using pump make model</p>
<p>all of that again from an eam system or</p>
<p>a maintenance system or the digital twin</p>
<p>system so that I have Rich data that</p>
<p>sits over here now how we put that</p>
<p>together so these are all listeners</p>
<p>you'll see the blue ones that's how we</p>
<p>get real-time data in and this is just a</p>
<p>subset but you'll see there's a huge</p>
<p>bunch of different protocols and</p>
<p>applications and services</p>
<p>and streaming platforms and and that we</p>
<p>pre that we support in in putting this</p>
<p>together the context might model all</p>
<p>this this is all fast moving data all</p>
<p>the slow moving data</p>
<p>um I can get through from all the</p>
<p>contextual data mic model</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>yeah again</p>
<p>weather patterns anything that I require</p>
<p>so if I'm doing flood predictions or</p>
<p>that kind of thing you know I can get it</p>
<p>for Weather Services or against</p>
<p>different</p>
<p>contextual data sources Transformations</p>
<p>is when we change the shape of the data</p>
<p>so cleaning it doing calculations I'm</p>
<p>changing it and you'll see there's a</p>
<p>there's a number of ones that are around</p>
<p>cleaning the data missing value</p>
<p>substitution</p>
<p>aggregation calculations uh</p>
<p>normalizing</p>
<p>setting up thresholds and um</p>
<p>and a number of these where we actually</p>
<p>transform the data this one doesn't have</p>
<p>machine learning in I'll show you an ex</p>
<p>machine learning example in a minute but</p>
<p>this is where we can bring in I can just</p>
<p>drag on anomaly detection and it's not</p>
<p>probably the right place to do it here</p>
<p>but just to illustrate the concept and</p>
<p>then I configure that each of these are</p>
<p>configurable so you can see this</p>
<p>pantelemetry one there's the</p>
<p>configuration for that so in order and</p>
<p>it will interrogate the underlying</p>
<p>service and come back with what are the</p>
<p>fields that this thing actually has and</p>
<p>I can now use that in my data stream or</p>
<p>if I go to something more sophisticated</p>
<p>like as a digital twin example it will</p>
<p>use some of the</p>
<p>xero trust capability credential</p>
<p>management which is all in our</p>
<p>subscription and in our in our</p>
<p>subscription manager installed in the in</p>
<p>the in the variable side but this is</p>
<p>where I would create for example I can</p>
<p>create a whole new instance in Azure</p>
<p>right from the application in here so</p>
<p>these are the kind of applic the the</p>
<p>configuration in a no code way of</p>
<p>setting up these data streams and each</p>
<p>of these have their own unique set of</p>
<p>properties</p>
<p>that we activate for each of those</p>
<p>I just discarded</p>
<p>um and then</p>
<p>that's the machine learning part so I</p>
<p>can bring in machine learning I'll show</p>
<p>you an example in a minute I could this</p>
<p>calculation might be quite Advanced and</p>
<p>I may actually want to do that in like</p>
<p>python so I want to maybe use my my</p>
<p>um bump calculations and efficiency</p>
<p>there might be a library that I'm</p>
<p>already using and again we support all</p>
<p>of those libraries out of the box</p>
<p>um in in this</p>
<p>the functions so that's more statistical</p>
<p>mathematical things like fast four years</p>
<p>geofencing and a whole bunch of goal</p>
<p>seeking similar to what you find in</p>
<p>Excel recommendations area that I'll</p>
<p>touch on in a minute but that's a whole</p>
<p>area on its own and then lastly action</p>
<p>agents so this is where we create</p>
<p>actions so it could be something like</p>
<p>send an email</p>
<p>or create ethereum smart contract</p>
<p>completely to ends of the scale but</p>
<p>that's really or create work orders in</p>
<p>Maxima update other databases</p>
<p>send it back to systems a very</p>
<p>comprehensive set now these are all this</p>
<p>is an extensible framework so if we</p>
<p>don't have a connector or don't have the</p>
<p>function that you that you require here</p>
<p>it's very easy to put that together we</p>
<p>can do it our partners do it our</p>
<p>customers do it and there's a framework</p>
<p>in order to create these connectors</p>
<p>yourself so this is at a really high</p>
<p>level what we're doing here so this is a</p>
<p>very basic one and there's actually a</p>
<p>live view of this so this is live data</p>
<p>coming through this is not the user</p>
<p>interface that I use every day to look</p>
<p>at my data but it helps me just to</p>
<p>understand am I getting the right data</p>
<p>at the right</p>
<p>point of this data flow and the way that</p>
<p>I for example</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>map and configure the endpoints or</p>
<p>getting the data in so you'll see in</p>
<p>this data flow it's interrogating adx</p>
<p>service and so what can you accept and</p>
<p>then we can bring in</p>
<p>from the from the</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>from the</p>
<p>next effect let me see if the Azure</p>
<p>digital twin one is configured to</p>
<p>show that up</p>
<p>so yeah as you'll see this one is</p>
<p>already configured to send the data into</p>
<p>Azure digital twin it will interrogate</p>
<p>the twin service and see what it can</p>
<p>accept this is what I have in my</p>
<p>Pipeline and we can Auto map that and it</p>
<p>will get that</p>
<p>into the data flow very simple example</p>
<p>but really effective in terms of getting</p>
<p>condition monitoring on assets going</p>
<p>as you get more advanced and more</p>
<p>sophisticated you may want to start</p>
<p>adding some predictive capability and in</p>
<p>this instance we're reading some some of</p>
<p>the data from a historian like osisoft</p>
<p>we're getting some other data from a</p>
<p>sensor based solution which has got IPC</p>
<p>UI running we've got some</p>
<p>Azure iot hubs and some of the other</p>
<p>capabilities and these are all the data</p>
<p>wrangling data cleaning and everything</p>
<p>that I need to do</p>
<p>and adding context from sap on mic model</p>
<p>and geolocation a whole bunch of other</p>
<p>information before I can actually and</p>
<p>converting failure tags and doing all of</p>
<p>this this is really hard if you do it in</p>
<p>code</p>
<p>what if you do it yeah it's really easy</p>
<p>to understand the logic but also to</p>
<p>troubleshoot and it's much easier to to</p>
<p>understand the logic of what you've done</p>
<p>in order to get this to this point what</p>
<p>I can now do is do my pump calculations</p>
<p>as you saw exactly the same calculation</p>
<p>as in the previous example but I'm going</p>
<p>to update my Azure digital twin in this</p>
<p>instance so I've got three actions</p>
<p>coming out of this block go and update</p>
<p>it with that data run an anomaly</p>
<p>detection on the pump performance</p>
<p>simple anomaly detection or have a more</p>
<p>sophisticated binary classification to</p>
<p>say to say is it likely to fail yes or</p>
<p>no and if it is you know what's a</p>
<p>remaining useful life model which we may</p>
<p>have for the pump</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>and I'll show you an example of how that</p>
<p>can be put together merge all those data</p>
<p>and again send it to the recommend to</p>
<p>the what we call the recommendation</p>
<p>engine and run that recommendation you</p>
<p>may notice some little red legs on here</p>
<p>this is where you can configure a error</p>
<p>handling flow so if there's a problem</p>
<p>with this what do you want it to do who</p>
<p>must it alert what what must it let you</p>
<p>know</p>
<p>and or whatever system do you want to</p>
<p>activate when you have an error or</p>
<p>whether this data from the historian is</p>
<p>not coming through so this is the data</p>
<p>streams very very powerful this is where</p>
<p>80 of the work happens if you remember</p>
<p>the tip of the iceberg this is a nice</p>
<p>visualization all the heavy lifting</p>
<p>happens at the bottom this is what</p>
<p>happens over here</p>
<p>before we go back to the app designer</p>
<p>and recommendations and how we configure</p>
<p>them so as I said this remaining useful</p>
<p>life regression model</p>
<p>so where do you get them well inside XM</p>
<p>Pro we've now built in</p>
<p>jupyter Notebook so you can create these</p>
<p>models here and deploy them here here's</p>
<p>an example of reminding useful life</p>
<p>using a random Forest</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>to do the to do the um</p>
<p>the the model and I can see what what</p>
<p>senses and what influence and what is</p>
<p>the Affinity of and the correlation of</p>
<p>the data on this and then based on that</p>
<p>so this</p>
<p>um regression model that's built on</p>
<p>random forests</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>um as an as an example we'll then output</p>
<p>the right model for me we also big</p>
<p>supporters of things like Auto ml so if</p>
<p>you don't know what model to use it can</p>
<p>suggest and um and the output of this</p>
<p>model then goes into something like ml</p>
<p>flow so just another one you saw the</p>
<p>example of the beer the beer quality</p>
<p>what we're doing in this one is we can</p>
<p>even generate synthetic data if we don't</p>
<p>have the right data we can kind of</p>
<p>generate the data that the more that we</p>
<p>want the model to be trained on</p>
<p>and we can even use chat GPT to ask it</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>help us with the</p>
<p>um the visualization of this information</p>
<p>so it will write the code so you can see</p>
<p>here we're asking GPT we've got a magic</p>
<p>command for charge GPT built into this</p>
<p>so how can I visualize the data as a</p>
<p>correlation Matrix and it gives you the</p>
<p>code we can I can then run that code and</p>
<p>this gives me the correlation Matrix for</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>this is where I get into creating the</p>
<p>actual model and deploying that to</p>
<p>something like ml5 there is a webinar on</p>
<p>our website that goes into a lot more</p>
<p>detail I'm not going to spend more time</p>
<p>on this right now but just you can</p>
<p>automate building models right through</p>
<p>so that in the data stream if even if I</p>
<p>retrain my model I don't have to go and</p>
<p>update it here it will automatically be</p>
<p>updated</p>
<p>the last thing I want to touch on is the</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>recommendations and as you see we've got</p>
<p>a recommendation here now how did we set</p>
<p>up these recommendations there's another</p>
<p>one over here so for the pump discharge</p>
<p>so how did we set up this recommendation</p>
<p>and there's a whole area where I can</p>
<p>manage all of them look at how and look</p>
<p>at Who's got what and where it is but</p>
<p>there's also rules where I set up the</p>
<p>rules side so if I go to the bump you'll</p>
<p>see these all the different categories</p>
<p>so the pump discharge pressure was the</p>
<p>one that we had a rule</p>
<p>so there were actually two rules</p>
<p>so it would First Look for out of</p>
<p>efficiency range and then it will look</p>
<p>out of optimal range so if this one is</p>
<p>not if it's not true then it will</p>
<p>continue and to go so it enforces a</p>
<p>execution order and it gets data from my</p>
<p>pump Telemetry data stream</p>
<p>that that sends the the data through and</p>
<p>that's how it interrogates that</p>
<p>um if I look at I'll just use this quick</p>
<p>example to show you this is the nice</p>
<p>description that you saw at the top with</p>
<p>a nice icon and everything but this is</p>
<p>the heart of it where I have the</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>flow rate</p>
<p>and less than a third between a certain</p>
<p>band and the discharge project is</p>
<p>listening as soon as that rule is true</p>
<p>it puts that little red dot on there for</p>
<p>me and puts the it puts the</p>
<p>recommendation on the on the list and I</p>
<p>can now get that information now where I</p>
<p>get this flow rate you'll see there's a</p>
<p>whole bunch of parameters that's</p>
<p>actually what comes out the bottom here</p>
<p>so that what comes at the end of the</p>
<p>pipe over there</p>
<p>is what I now have available</p>
<p>to build this for me and I can use</p>
<p>different calculations and this can be a</p>
<p>value or it could be another parameter</p>
<p>so I can actually build a very Dynamic</p>
<p>set of rules including predictions and</p>
<p>everything that can come down the pipe</p>
<p>now this is not a valid rule where the</p>
<p>flow rate is not equal to the motor</p>
<p>current well hopefully that's not the</p>
<p>case but</p>
<p>that is gives you an idea of how you can</p>
<p>construct this so it could be completely</p>
<p>different because I can bring in very</p>
<p>different information I can bring</p>
<p>weather information I can bring all</p>
<p>sorts of</p>
<p>um I can bring maintenance record so if</p>
<p>there's if there's no</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>if the</p>
<p>if a certain condition exists then it's</p>
<p>minus 40 degrees outside then don't</p>
<p>create the work order because no human</p>
<p>can work in those conditions we have</p>
<p>seen some of those applications as well</p>
<p>so if a safety factor and all of those</p>
<p>you can bring in if they're or if</p>
<p>there's hot equipment nearby then notify</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>so that's how I built the rule and as</p>
<p>you saw in this instance I've enabled</p>
<p>the form and the form was a work request</p>
<p>but there are some other form types and</p>
<p>you can build your own forms as well and</p>
<p>this is just some of the how many times</p>
<p>does it need to log it can it</p>
<p>automatically resolve it so if it</p>
<p>condition is not true anymore will it</p>
<p>automatically resolve</p>
<p>these all capabilities that are built</p>
<p>into our recommendation engine very</p>
<p>sophisticated capability that you can</p>
<p>track but also this is what I put in</p>
<p>triage instructions notifications so</p>
<p>do I want to know when there's a new</p>
<p>alert when there's a status change how</p>
<p>might you know if there's certain</p>
<p>thresholds being not met on time because</p>
<p>we're waiting too long for someone to</p>
<p>respond to it so those are all</p>
<p>capabilities of</p>
<p>the um and the last thing I want to do</p>
<p>is just very briefly touch on as I said</p>
<p>I'll explain a little bit you can see</p>
<p>now that I've played around with it</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>there's definitely a higher</p>
<p>probability of failure that has gone up</p>
<p>due to some of some of the things that</p>
<p>I'm doing at the back here</p>
<p>um that's not what I wanted to do</p>
<p>this is um so when I clicked on the</p>
<p>pencil I have access to be able to edit</p>
<p>this you can actually see both of these</p>
<p>the 2D and the 3D they just overlaid on</p>
<p>top of each other and there's the name</p>
<p>black so that's how I got that done this</p>
<p>is a page builder web page builder in</p>
<p>this instance this is a Unity model and</p>
<p>this is just a 2d graphic both of them</p>
<p>have the same data that it displays and</p>
<p>these are all wired up data sources</p>
<p>and when I'm what I mean by a wired up</p>
<p>data source if I click on this Unity</p>
<p>block well let me first explain the</p>
<p>concept of a block there's a whole bunch</p>
<p>of different types of blocks</p>
<p>there are recommendation blocks action</p>
<p>blocks</p>
<p>and visualization blocks so that's where</p>
<p>we had Autodesk Forge and esri and unity</p>
<p>and all of these different visualization</p>
<p>capabilities that we have and we can</p>
<p>also create widgets so if I like this</p>
<p>style of something that I've built I can</p>
<p>actually go and create a widget for that</p>
<p>and these are just some examples so we</p>
<p>just can be saved and they can be shared</p>
<p>so if I've built a really nice widget</p>
<p>based out of a grouping of things so for</p>
<p>example I just press the</p>
<p>save there and whatever built in here</p>
<p>and now is available as a widget next</p>
<p>time I just drag the implied on and I</p>
<p>have a a name plate available they might</p>
<p>even be on here already</p>
<p>but that's typically how I create</p>
<p>widgets the data that sits behind this</p>
<p>so again I'm clicking on the unity model</p>
<p>here you'll see it gets the yellow line</p>
<p>around it</p>
<p>this is just how I'm the layout style</p>
<p>how it will react when it goes on a</p>
<p>mobile device in terms of its Flex</p>
<p>layout or but the block properties this</p>
<p>is where the actual</p>
<p>models reside</p>
<p>and we support both newer and older</p>
<p>versions of</p>
<p>of unity as an example these are where</p>
<p>the files reside and if I look at the</p>
<p>data the that is that resides on this um</p>
<p>certainly just um</p>
<p>so the data sources is the pump readings</p>
<p>um but on this overall page these are</p>
<p>all the data sources and if I look at my</p>
<p>live data where it's coming from</p>
<p>that's actually from the data source so</p>
<p>you'll see the</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>this is this is not the expression don't</p>
<p>want to bring the expression so I just</p>
<p>want to find the data source for it so I</p>
<p>can build very sophisticated</p>
<p>data connectivity this one is using</p>
<p>um that that data stream</p>
<p>connector it could be using a digital</p>
<p>twins it could use maintenance schedules</p>
<p>SQL data there's many different</p>
<p>connectors that we have oops</p>
<p>don't want to delete that as you can see</p>
<p>there's some some built-in capabilities</p>
<p>for people like myself that are not</p>
<p>coders or so it will help with not</p>
<p>screwing it up completely so</p>
<p>this is and also starting a new</p>
<p>application you can start from templates</p>
<p>so you can say well this one with the um</p>
<p>this pump one I'm not sure what so</p>
<p>you'll see this one has actually got a</p>
<p>series of drill down pages and</p>
<p>everything that's already associated</p>
<p>with it so I can use this as a starting</p>
<p>template to get started quickly</p>
<p>so this is how we look at</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>providing digital twin capabilities in</p>
<p>terms of Maintenance predictive</p>
<p>maintenance condition monitoring for</p>
<p>facilities management</p>
