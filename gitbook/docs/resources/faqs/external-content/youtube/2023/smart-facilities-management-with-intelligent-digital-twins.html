<summary>Transcript</summary>
<p>this is just a quick introduction to</p>
<p>Smart facilities management using</p>
<p>intelligent digital Twins and it will</p>
<p>give you a common operating picture that</p>
<p>puts you in control</p>
<p>when we talk to</p>
<p>asset managers and Facility Owners we</p>
<p>hear some of the challenges that they</p>
<p>see is really around asset monitoring</p>
<p>prioritizing repairs budget constraints</p>
<p>emergencies and unplanned events</p>
<p>trying to coordinate with other</p>
<p>departments vandalism public misuse</p>
<p>Regulatory Compliance technology</p>
<p>integration vendor and contract</p>
<p>management</p>
<p>public engagement and and feedback staff</p>
<p>training and management and also</p>
<p>environmental concerns so quite a</p>
<p>complex set of challenges that</p>
<p>facilities managers are trying to</p>
<p>address and digital twins help in some</p>
<p>way to address some of this so some of</p>
<p>the typical applications or use cases</p>
<p>and these are this is just a few</p>
<p>examples</p>
<p>that digital twins are being applied to</p>
<p>in facilities management is really</p>
<p>around predictive maintenance for</p>
<p>infrastructure helping with asset</p>
<p>monitoring and prioritizing repairs</p>
<p>having sensors there it can predict when</p>
<p>assets May Fail and it can use all sorts</p>
<p>of algorithms and things like that we'll</p>
<p>we'll dive a little bit deeper into it</p>
<p>and I'll show you some examples of how</p>
<p>it does it</p>
<p>another application area or use cases</p>
<p>around resource optimization and</p>
<p>budgeting really helping with budget</p>
<p>constraints which quite often is one of</p>
<p>the bigger challenges for facilities</p>
<p>compared to other Industries</p>
<p>we also deal quite often with things</p>
<p>like Disaster Response and recovery from</p>
<p>that so knowing when certain certain</p>
<p>events and emergencies unplanned events</p>
<p>happen and what can be done</p>
<p>even with that operations intelligence</p>
<p>real-time intelligence getting that</p>
<p>common operating picture knowing what to</p>
<p>do next</p>
<p>the other key challenge that we that we</p>
<p>address with digital twins is</p>
<p>integration to other external systems</p>
<p>and quite often there's a whole bunch of</p>
<p>departments in different silos they're</p>
<p>done really well work well together and</p>
<p>it's one of the benefits that a digital</p>
<p>twin can bring is being able to</p>
<p>integrate that so for example of a</p>
<p>rainwater main breaks always predicted</p>
<p>to to to break then that information can</p>
<p>be relayed to things like traffic and</p>
<p>traffic Management systems and other</p>
<p>applications and and systems that are in</p>
<p>the organization</p>
<p>and quite often the influence of the</p>
<p>public and trying to keep them involved</p>
<p>as well as updated is one of the key use</p>
<p>cases that again is slightly different</p>
<p>in Facilities Management to what we see</p>
<p>in some of the other Industries now</p>
<p>this is all around very specific use</p>
<p>cases and if we come from a controller</p>
<p>automation engineering background</p>
<p>you should be familiar with this ISO 95</p>
<p>model which is kind of the Purdue model</p>
<p>or how we control have controllers and</p>
<p>things in the plant and throughout our</p>
<p>our facilities and how that rolls up</p>
<p>into skyde systems and the different</p>
<p>Management Systems so those are</p>
<p>typically referred to as</p>
<p>distributed control systems and</p>
<p>Facilities Management they vary</p>
<p>depending on what the type of</p>
<p>infrastructure it is that you are trying</p>
<p>to manage so if you go to pump water</p>
<p>filtration plants pumping stations more</p>
<p>sophisticated than what you find in some</p>
<p>of the</p>
<p>recreational Services areas like parks</p>
<p>and some of the others but what we've</p>
<p>done is we've taken that same picture</p>
<p>and kind of flipped it over and said so</p>
<p>what what does a digital twin provide</p>
<p>for you if you've got a distributed</p>
<p>um control system on the one hand this</p>
<p>gives you a distributed intelligence</p>
<p>system by using all of these different</p>
<p>use cases and that's the main difference</p>
<p>between having a digital twin and just</p>
<p>have for those previous few use cases</p>
<p>that I showed just have some point</p>
<p>solutions that that work in isolation</p>
<p>what you can now do is at your</p>
<p>facilities level at the at the plant</p>
<p>level you can have multiple different</p>
<p>use cases</p>
<p>and again we'll touch on on some of them</p>
<p>I'll show you examples of that but we</p>
<p>can start rolling them up integrating a</p>
<p>more compa</p>
<p>composite one that gives us a better</p>
<p>tactical view so this might be</p>
<p>operational at the lower level getting</p>
<p>to a more of a tactical view at the next</p>
<p>level</p>
<p>and then being able to bring in business</p>
<p>logic business rules</p>
<p>and models at a</p>
<p>at a higher level which will give us the</p>
<p>ability to create this control tower now</p>
<p>if we combine the two we actually get a</p>
<p>new level a strategic level and that's</p>
<p>the common operating picture or this</p>
<p>executive control tower that gives us</p>
<p>the opportunity to to make better</p>
<p>decisions even though at level one where</p>
<p>the digital twin operate its use case is</p>
<p>still very specific like we saw in the</p>
<p>previous example where or the the</p>
<p>previous slide where we it's</p>
<p>specifically around certain asset</p>
<p>maintenance or event response or those</p>
<p>but it's the combination of being able</p>
<p>to bring all of that together it's a</p>
<p>real benefit of the digital twin</p>
<p>and now you also have some levers that</p>
<p>you can pull depending on budget States</p>
<p>or some other uh</p>
<p>operational or strategic levers that you</p>
<p>may have you can change some of the</p>
<p>business rules and that will influence</p>
<p>how these digital Twins then behave so</p>
<p>can we spend more money on predictive</p>
<p>maintenance</p>
<p>what is the situation with our staffing</p>
<p>in terms of resources and and that kind</p>
<p>of thing</p>
<p>so this is the real opportunity with</p>
<p>digital twins being able to create this</p>
<p>common operating picture by stringing</p>
<p>together or building it up from multiple</p>
<p>different use cases so the core Focus</p>
<p>for Us is around the use case and the</p>
<p>way that we like to do this in practice</p>
<p>how do we actually build this is to</p>
<p>create this common operating picture</p>
<p>you've got the assets on the left hand</p>
<p>side and then we have this capability</p>
<p>which we call data stream designer that</p>
<p>can suck information from multiple</p>
<p>different systems</p>
<p>and it can transform it it can apply</p>
<p>some analytics to it and we can then</p>
<p>create some actions coming out of that</p>
<p>we can also bring in things like AI into</p>
<p>this and I'll be showing you some</p>
<p>examples of what this looks like in an</p>
<p>actual application</p>
<p>um for predictive maintenance</p>
<p>you don't always have to have the AI</p>
<p>side of it sometimes we just have</p>
<p>engineering calculations thresholds</p>
<p>those kind of things more condition</p>
<p>monitoring but as we move to predictive</p>
<p>maintenance and predictive use cases</p>
<p>predictive operations</p>
<p>we start bringing in more AI</p>
<p>the XM Pro app designer is the third</p>
<p>element so this is the visualization and</p>
<p>this visualization is not there to</p>
<p>replace existing 3D GIS models or Point</p>
<p>scans and things that we've done or</p>
<p>Bim models or that it is really taking</p>
<p>those and actually using some of those</p>
<p>user interfaces like Gia systems and</p>
<p>putting the contextual information</p>
<p>around it with the recommendations which</p>
<p>is the next step that's actually what</p>
<p>you really want to in certain events</p>
<p>occur or likely to occur</p>
<p>you want to create a recommendation for</p>
<p>someone to do something it might be to</p>
<p>investigate it it might be to repair it</p>
<p>it might be to</p>
<p>discard it it doesn't matter what it</p>
<p>what the what the outcome is different</p>
<p>scenarios will have different outcomes</p>
<p>but how can we make sure that we have</p>
<p>consistency around what the recommended</p>
<p>action is so that we can Empower people</p>
<p>processes and provide some automation</p>
<p>around this as we go forward</p>
<p>around certain areas or outcomes in our</p>
<p>operations</p>
<p>a little bit more sophisticated version</p>
<p>of the same common number writing</p>
<p>pictures I've got all of these things on</p>
<p>the left hand side senses I've got all</p>
<p>of these systems inside my organization</p>
<p>and I'm trying to get the response done</p>
<p>with people processes and automation</p>
<p>and what we do we have this</p>
<p>user interface where we can in a visual</p>
<p>way build the data streams again get</p>
<p>data from multiple different systems</p>
<p>apply analytics to it provide context to</p>
<p>it so not only do I can I bring in</p>
<p>sensor data but I can bring in</p>
<p>maintenance records I can bring in</p>
<p>weather data I can bring in all sorts of</p>
<p>data and build a for my specific problem</p>
<p>a a data stream that will feed and give</p>
<p>me the the information that I need</p>
<p>to create a common operating picture and</p>
<p>in this common operating picture you can</p>
<p>see at the operational level at the</p>
<p>bottom the Tactical level which is the</p>
<p>planning level and the Strategic level</p>
<p>everyone's looking at the same data but</p>
<p>through a different lens for different</p>
<p>reasons for different things that I want</p>
<p>to see at the top it's more kpis</p>
<p>at the middle level it's more on</p>
<p>planning when we have when do we have</p>
<p>multiple things</p>
<p>in the workshop at the same time and</p>
<p>we're over capacity so we can't actually</p>
<p>deal with that and at the bottom you</p>
<p>know looking at the actual facility and</p>
<p>while I'm there what's happening</p>
<p>um do it but it's all the same data and</p>
<p>this is what we call event intelligence</p>
<p>and now when certain events occur</p>
<p>based on the real-time data</p>
<p>we can turn that into operations</p>
<p>intelligence for for the decision</p>
<p>support and if we combine that with</p>
<p>recommendations which is a key element</p>
<p>of our solution</p>
<p>through our recommendation manager and</p>
<p>recommendation rules</p>
<p>that can also bring in from other alarms</p>
<p>and alerts and things that you may have</p>
<p>in the organization but at this at the</p>
<p>highest level and at the lowest level it</p>
<p>all works the same and you can combine</p>
<p>all sorts of different systems to create</p>
<p>a set of recommendation rules and I'll</p>
<p>be showing you what that looks like</p>
<p>it enables you to empower the smartest</p>
<p>people in your business to pull the</p>
<p>levers as I mentioned earlier</p>
<p>it will reduce the risk of being</p>
<p>blindsided by key business events that</p>
<p>are happening or likely to happen and it</p>
<p>also improves the accountability because</p>
<p>you now create a feedback loop a closed</p>
<p>loop feedback system</p>
<p>so that you have the visibility around</p>
<p>you know always getting better are we</p>
<p>closing the work orders you know</p>
<p>is the facility running better so you</p>
<p>can create those closed loop monitoring</p>
<p>capability that also improves the</p>
<p>accountability for that</p>
<p>as you can see we've got some elements</p>
<p>in terms of what is in excellent Pro</p>
<p>um so we call that our intelligent</p>
<p>digital twin Suite consists of four</p>
<p>different areas the data stream designer</p>
<p>AI the app designer and the</p>
<p>recommendation manager and before we go</p>
<p>into that I'd like to highlight uh</p>
<p>something that we quite often see when</p>
<p>we talk about digital twins people just</p>
<p>see the visualization part they see this</p>
<p>really nice</p>
<p>digital twin user experience that has</p>
<p>got dashboards it's got bi it's got 3D</p>
<p>it's got IR VR all sorts of really nice</p>
<p>looking visual interaction the challenge</p>
<p>with that is uh</p>
<p>that that is just the visualization</p>
<p>like this Iceberg the real challenge 80</p>
<p>of the work sit below the surface and</p>
<p>that is where you need to make sure that</p>
<p>it's safe secure reliable that it's</p>
<p>trustworthy you need to be able to</p>
<p>integrate all these different systems</p>
<p>and then Wrangle that data provide</p>
<p>analytics over that being able to bring</p>
<p>in things like AI that it's not just</p>
<p>Standalone but it's that it's baked into</p>
<p>the business process and then creating</p>
<p>these recommendations that can run on</p>
<p>top of that that is all the things that</p>
<p>are required to actually build a</p>
<p>successful digital twin at the end of</p>
<p>the day it's not just about the user</p>
<p>interface that sits at the top</p>
<p>and what we're starting to see in some</p>
<p>instances we don't even need a user</p>
<p>interface because we can automate the</p>
<p>whole process</p>
<p>for those tedious things that you</p>
<p>actually don't want a human to</p>
<p>to get involved with so what I'll be</p>
<p>doing next is taking you through an</p>
<p>example we'll just take the predictive</p>
<p>maintenance for infrastructure</p>
<p>and looking at a facility management</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>application at a very high level in</p>
<p>terms of how we how we address that</p>
<p>specific challenge now for us from a</p>
<p>smart Asset Management point of view it</p>
<p>is really how do we connect to the data</p>
<p>how do we provide the recommendations</p>
<p>and alerts for the planning team so be</p>
<p>able to to plan work then actually</p>
<p>create the work orders work requests</p>
<p>into the backend systems that you may</p>
<p>already have</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>augment that with additional information</p>
<p>so that it's not just this things like</p>
<p>safety information additional context</p>
<p>operational information that you can</p>
<p>actually pass on to that work ordering</p>
<p>request to make it more rich and then</p>
<p>also checking or verifying that the work</p>
<p>has been done so for us that's the</p>
<p>closed loop process that we like to</p>
<p>follow around smartassive management</p>
<p>and in terms of use cases for facilities</p>
<p>management we see applications around</p>
<p>condition monitoring prescriptive</p>
<p>maintenance predictive maintenance</p>
<p>machine intelligence this is where we're</p>
<p>getting to move the real-time</p>
<p>operational side of things or autonomous</p>
<p>operations</p>
<p>and from a talk from a technology aspect</p>
<p>it uses things what we call composable</p>
<p>so we can make reusable blocks so we</p>
<p>don't have to build it every single time</p>
<p>make some really smart integration</p>
<p>automate some of the business process</p>
<p>areas of that and we try to do all of</p>
<p>this in a no code application</p>
<p>development which environment which I'll</p>
<p>show you so that you don't have to code</p>
<p>the stuff</p>
<p>and lastly the real objective of this is</p>
<p>that you can</p>
<p>reduce downtime increase the asset life</p>
<p>and the cost that you have around it but</p>
<p>we also see more and more that there's</p>
<p>emphasis on the ESG side of things the</p>
<p>environmental societal and government uh</p>
<p>the the the the governance requirements</p>
<p>so that is the objective of of using</p>
<p>digital twins to help you with smart</p>
<p>Asset Management now before we go into</p>
<p>the example and also just take a a brief</p>
<p>minute to explain how we often see the</p>
<p>journey happens because</p>
<p>you may have so many different things</p>
<p>that you could potentially do and one of</p>
<p>the approaches is to look at from a</p>
<p>for the predictive maintenance condition</p>
<p>monitoring prescriptive maintenance type</p>
<p>use cases is to go and look at or</p>
<p>analyze who are The Bad actors and what</p>
<p>percentage of impact do they have so you</p>
<p>can see the size of the block they</p>
<p>represent that I can also then look for</p>
<p>a certain bad actor maybe say it's in</p>
<p>the pump stations and certain</p>
<p>centrifugal pumps I can look at the type</p>
<p>of failure modes that they have you know</p>
<p>the bearing failure see all failures</p>
<p>um whatever it may be and then for those</p>
<p>failure modes trying to understand what</p>
<p>the root causes are</p>
<p>and the reason why that why we want to</p>
<p>have the root cause is that we know what</p>
<p>to look for so what are the lead</p>
<p>indicators that tell us something is</p>
<p>causing so which will cause a certain</p>
<p>failure and that results in the bad</p>
<p>actor</p>
<p>so now that we understand what the root</p>
<p>causes are and what and the the this is</p>
<p>really the bread and butter of a lot of</p>
<p>Maintenance organizations that we have</p>
<p>right or the the work that we see being</p>
<p>done right now</p>
<p>so understanding what the root causes</p>
<p>are</p>
<p>and then look for what are the lead</p>
<p>indicators for that root cause so is it</p>
<p>the is it the the</p>
<p>plan maintenance history the tonnage the</p>
<p>motor arms the vibration the flow the</p>
<p>whatever the lead indicators are and</p>
<p>that from what systems do we need to</p>
<p>bring them so that we can create these</p>
<p>rules either rule-based AI based</p>
<p>the person who's been there 30 years and</p>
<p>also applying some engineering</p>
<p>calculations because most of the things</p>
<p>that we do still subscribe to the lower</p>
<p>laws of physics so we can use our</p>
<p>engineering calculations to do that so</p>
<p>that's just some other approach that we</p>
<p>take but to get back to how the software</p>
<p>worked led me jump in and briefly show</p>
<p>you so I'm going to start with with</p>
<p>again with this picture we have the data</p>
<p>stream designer</p>
<p>um and that gives us the ability to</p>
<p>embed AI as well the visualization</p>
<p>aspect is in the app designer and we</p>
<p>have the recommendation manager that</p>
<p>drives it I will start with the app</p>
<p>designer number three the the user</p>
<p>interface so if you recall our</p>
<p>tip of the iceberg I'll start with the</p>
<p>application designer show you what the</p>
<p>what or how we</p>
<p>the the the the the the information the</p>
<p>interaction and then I'll show you</p>
<p>behind the scenes below the water line</p>
<p>how we do this</p>
