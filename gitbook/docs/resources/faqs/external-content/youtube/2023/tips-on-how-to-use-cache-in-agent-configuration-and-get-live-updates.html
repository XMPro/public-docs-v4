<p>üé• Title: Tips on how to use cache in agent configuration and get live updates | In-depth with Gavin Green</p>
<p>üîç Description:</p>
<p>Join Gavin Green in our latest installment from the &quot;In-depth with Gavin Green&quot; playlist as he delves deep into XMPro agent configurations. In this video, you'll learn:</p>
<p>The ins and outs of agent identifiers, cache sizes, and how to best utilize them for your needs. The distinction between caching 20 records overall vs. caching 20 records per unique identifier. A crucial tip on ensuring live data updates on your app without the constant need to refresh the page. How different data sources, like SQL, might affect your live update configurations. Whether you're a beginner trying to understand the basics or looking to refine your XMPro knowledge, this tutorial offers valuable insights and tips to ensure optimal performance and user experience. Make sure you don't miss the often-overlooked live update checkbox that can significantly elevate your app's responsiveness!</p>

<p>so if I come back into this</p>
<p>um I logged on with the user that</p>
<p>doesn't have access but that's perfectly</p>
<p>fine if you look at the agent over here</p>
<p>you can see that we have the URL the key</p>
<p>but down here where we start seeing</p>
<p>identifier typically the identifier</p>
<p>would be you know a unique identifier</p>
<p>and asset key Etc so I'm assuming stop</p>
<p>ID is the identifier yeah</p>
<p>and then down the bottom if you're</p>
<p>looking for multiple from the cache size</p>
<p>so you want 20 records from the cash</p>
<p>site typically you would include the</p>
<p>identifier in that option as well as you</p>
<p>know a timestamp or I'm assuming if the</p>
<p>uh the longitude is going to change</p>
<p>that will allow you to get the 20</p>
<p>records</p>
<p>so the the only thing here would be to</p>
<p>make sure that you just select the the</p>
<p>stop ID there and then just apply it</p>
<p>now when you come to cash per entity and</p>
<p>replace cache how the cache works is</p>
<p>this is storing data</p>
<p>that will be rendered and and visible on</p>
<p>the actual app side of things</p>
<p>so the the data coming in here because</p>
<p>you've specified a cache of 20.</p>
<p>and you haven't said cash per entity</p>
<p>you're only ever going to get 20 records</p>
<p>which might be what you're looking for</p>
<p>however if you want 20 records per stop</p>
<p>then what you do is by ticking this here</p>
<p>here and you select that option there</p>
<p>you're essentially going to create 20</p>
<p>per entity for stops that's how you</p>
<p>let's say you read the agent piece</p>
<p>coming down here so you got everything</p>
<p>else spot on</p>
<p>this is just an extra item here if that</p>
<p>is what you're looking for there are</p>
<p>times when you don't need it you just</p>
<p>want 20 records irrespective of you know</p>
<p>the the unique identifier or the stop ID</p>
<p>or the asset ID</p>
<p>however there are times when you</p>
<p>probably do want to have 20 per you know</p>
<p>stop ID</p>
<p>so just switch that option on there and</p>
<p>that'll help you with the caching pieces</p>
<p>um so now yeah let's not save the</p>
<p>changes</p>
<p>the data coming now when we come in here</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>this was some of the access rights that</p>
<p>I had to just make sure what accent</p>
<p>yes I do</p>
<p>um to just reallocate to to your user so</p>
<p>how you configure it is correct so here</p>
<p>what you want to do is</p>
<p>um let's set it</p>
<p>live data is coming in</p>
<p>for for that connector and then here you</p>
<p>just want to scroll down and actually</p>
<p>look for</p>
<p>your data stream now you may have</p>
<p>noticed you have access to a lot of</p>
<p>other data streams yeah I'm going to</p>
<p>explain I'll explain where those came</p>
<p>from and why we gave you access to them</p>
<p>once you've clicked that it'll bring in</p>
<p>the primary key for you</p>
<p>this bottom option here you need to</p>
<p>select it and then you can click save</p>
<p>now once you've selected that option now</p>
<p>you can actually pass some data to the</p>
<p>screen the reason you select this option</p>
<p>here</p>
<p>is</p>
<p>you want to be able to show this data</p>
<p>constantly changing on the app</p>
<p>without having to refresh the page</p>
<p>so what that means is if I</p>
<p>um if I don't tick the live option I</p>
<p>have to press F5 on the page every</p>
<p>single time to actually load it</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>what the the live update so you'll see</p>
<p>it keeps changing for the 20 the 20</p>
<p>records I don't have to let's just leave</p>
<p>the master I don't I don't have to</p>
<p>refresh the page or change the page</p>
<p>Etc it's the one item a few people tend</p>
<p>to miss the first time is they don't</p>
<p>check that box or know what that box</p>
<p>means and then when they get to this</p>
<p>page it'll load the first time</p>
<p>but to see the changes you have to press</p>
<p>F5 to to do that if you don't want that</p>
<p>you can just go back into the edit on</p>
<p>the page data and you just untick that</p>
<p>however whenever you're connecting to a</p>
<p>data stream like you're doing here it's</p>
<p>generally a good it's generally a good</p>
<p>thing to to take it because you don't</p>
<p>want to have to press F5 on the page</p>
<p>every single time the the point is to</p>
<p>get the live data coming through</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>now there are some data sources where</p>
<p>you can't do this</p>
<p>SQL is one of them</p>
<p>so if you create a new connection so if</p>
<p>we go into the app data here and you say</p>
<p>you know what I actually want to connect</p>
<p>to to SQL and you configure all of this</p>
<p>you'll find that when you get to the</p>
<p>other side to actually use it SQL will</p>
<p>not have that option for you so it's not</p>
<p>something that every single one of these</p>
<p>connection has it's specific to the</p>
<p>connection that we're talking to make</p>
<p>sense</p>
