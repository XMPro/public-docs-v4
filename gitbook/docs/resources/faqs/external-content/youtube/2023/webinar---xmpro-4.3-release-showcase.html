<summary>Transcript</summary>hello everyone and welcome to the XM Pro
<p>4.3 release showcase</p>
<p>my name is Kim Marie Davenport product</p>
<p>manager here at XM Pro and I'm excited</p>
<p>to share with you the highlights of this</p>
<p>release in terms of what the features</p>
<p>are</p>
<p>they do and why you would benefit from</p>
<p>applying them in your ex in Pro</p>
<p>environment</p>
<p>if you have any questions please send</p>
<p>them through and we'll cover them at the</p>
<p>end</p>
<p>before we begin I'd like to point out</p>
<p>that today's content Builds on a couple</p>
<p>of prior webinars</p>
<p>haven't already watched them I'd highly</p>
<p>recommend that you do so</p>
<p>you can find them on our XM Pro channel</p>
<p>in YouTube</p>
<p>XM Pro CEO Peter Van scope explains the</p>
<p>concept of the intelligent digital twins</p>
<p>as well as going into detail on our</p>
<p>product strategy the intelligent digital</p>
<p>twins framework</p>
<p>also known as XM Pro i3c which stands</p>
<p>for integrated intelligent interactive</p>
<p>and composable</p>
<p>while that i3c framework is a longer</p>
<p>term view of where we're heading Daniel</p>
<p>King's product roadmap webinar describes</p>
<p>the items we're working on now and next</p>
<p>to get us there</p>
<p>every initiative that we work on falls</p>
<p>under one of the four pillars of the XM</p>
<p>Pro product</p>
<p>namely accelerate transformation Ai and</p>
<p>engineering</p>
<p>zero trust architecture and the cloud to</p>
<p>Edge continuum</p>
<p>together they support each of our three</p>
<p>themes</p>
<p>faster time to Value distributed</p>
<p>intelligence and security across</p>
<p>deployments</p>
<p>triangle layout illustrates how each of</p>
<p>these pillars support one another as</p>
<p>well as their varying impact on people</p>
<p>process and Technology</p>
<p>the 4.3 release contains new features</p>
<p>for both the cloud to Edge Continuum and</p>
<p>Ai and Engineering excellence</p>
<p>kicking off with the cloud to Edge</p>
<p>Continuum there are three features</p>
<p>included in</p>
<p>distributed casing through redis allows</p>
<p>us to run the distributed infrastructure</p>
<p>needed in Cloud to Edge computing</p>
<p>the other two features are complementary</p>
<p>health check endpoints is about</p>
<p>detecting an issue and roughly where</p>
<p>that issue lies and logging enables the</p>
<p>going in and doing analysis around</p>
<p>finding that problem</p>
<p>they are important groundwork on our</p>
<p>journey to be more agnostic more</p>
<p>performant and more scalable</p>
<p>allowing data to be accessed along that</p>
<p>continuum</p>
<p>now a health check endpoint is precisely</p>
<p>as it sounds a product service has a</p>
<p>health check API endpoint such as HTTP</p>
<p>forward slash help that Returns the help</p>
<p>of the service</p>
<p>when it is called the API endpoint</p>
<p>Handler performs various checks and</p>
<p>responds with the simple status of the</p>
<p>API and its dependencies</p>
<p>or unhealthy</p>
<p>when it is troubleshooting health checks</p>
<p>are the industry standard for the first</p>
<p>diagnostic step</p>
<p>they quickly indicate connectivity</p>
<p>health</p>
<p>either highlighting an issue such as</p>
<p>access to a database or allowing the</p>
<p>troubleshooter to rule out connectivity</p>
<p>and move on to their next check</p>
<p>we've implemented standard best practice</p>
<p>health check endpoints with two</p>
<p>different ways to consume this</p>
<p>information</p>
<p>in person or utilizing a diagnostic tool</p>
<p>as a baseline a person can monitor the</p>
<p>help UI which sits outside of our</p>
<p>product</p>
<p>it has to or you wouldn't be able to</p>
<p>access it if our products were not</p>
<p>healthy</p>
<p>however there is more to be gained by</p>
<p>configuring the raw Json API response to</p>
<p>be read by diagnostic tools such as</p>
<p>Azure with app insights</p>
<p>so that the endpoints are constantly</p>
<p>monitored on the infrastructure itself</p>
<p>you can build rules triggered if it goes</p>
<p>from healthy to unhealthy and when</p>
<p>triggered you can build actions such as</p>
<p>an email or a team's message or maybe</p>
<p>even to Auto scale</p>
<p>Health endpoints are crucial for</p>
<p>enabling self-healing functionalities in</p>
<p>your infrastructure</p>
<p>being able to automatically restart</p>
<p>unhealthy services on the edge</p>
<p>is extremely powerful in increasing</p>
<p>product uptime and performance</p>
<p>imagine if your application is running</p>
<p>on kubernetes and you can automatically</p>
<p>restart the service</p>
<p>or the Pod that it's running on and</p>
<p>hopefully get it back to a healthy state</p>
<p>the health checks are particularly</p>
<p>useful for customer installations on</p>
<p>their own infrastructure</p>
<p>there's always a risk that connectivity</p>
<p>might not have been opened on a service</p>
<p>that XM Pro needs and it's not</p>
<p>transparent that this is the case</p>
<p>time has been lost in previous</p>
<p>installations going through that</p>
<p>diagnosis process it requires certain</p>
<p>skill sets so it becomes time consuming</p>
<p>and costly to troubleshoot what may end</p>
<p>up being a trivial issue</p>
<p>with health checks now when you do the</p>
<p>initial installation you could for</p>
<p>example confirm application designer has</p>
<p>connectivity to subscription manager and</p>
<p>to its database</p>
<p>if it doesn't then we can tell straight</p>
<p>away that it can't connect and see the</p>
<p>relevant error message</p>
<p>the problem is narrowed down to</p>
<p>connectivity between two systems and</p>
<p>it's simple to proceed to The Next Step</p>
<p>which could be something like opening an</p>
<p>exception on the firewall</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>there are also day-to-day operations</p>
<p>where the environment in which XM Pro is</p>
<p>installed unexpectedly changes</p>
<p>whether it's the Cloud Server provide</p>
<p>running updates</p>
<p>sorry whether it's the cloud provider</p>
<p>running updates or deprecating</p>
<p>underlying functionality</p>
<p>or the customer themselves making</p>
<p>changes</p>
<p>these endpoints are available so that XM</p>
<p>Pro connectivity can be actively</p>
<p>monitored</p>
<p>connectivity is inadvertently broken</p>
<p>someone can be proactively notified of</p>
<p>an issue and investigate further</p>
<p>the loss of connectivity assists in</p>
<p>knowing which area is working as</p>
<p>expected and which area to troubleshoot</p>
<p>berder</p>
<p>let me take you to our product</p>
<p>documentation for a quick look</p>
<p>this is the</p>
<p>sorry this is the health path of an</p>
<p>application designer Services URL and</p>
<p>the raw API response</p>
<p>note the overall status is healthy and</p>
<p>that there is an entry for each of the</p>
<p>related product Service apis as well as</p>
<p>the database</p>
<p>observe the duration for each individual</p>
<p>check their healthy status as well as</p>
<p>the optional descriptive tags</p>
<p>next we'll look at the same information</p>
<p>using the Baseline help UI</p>
<p>here we can see in the top part</p>
<p>the same information for application</p>
<p>designer but it is a lot easier on the</p>
<p>human eye</p>
<p>the overall status is healthy</p>
<p>and again there are entries for each</p>
<p>related product service API as well as</p>
<p>the database</p>
<p>observe again the duration for each</p>
<p>check their healthy status as well as</p>
<p>the optional descriptive tags</p>
<p>our documentation includes an example of</p>
<p>how to configure the Xin pro products as</p>
<p>well as how to add third-party systems</p>
<p>that have health endpoints</p>
<p>a reminder that how you choose to use</p>
<p>these in health checks is up to you</p>
<p>our product is decoupled from any</p>
<p>specific cloud provider so that XM Pro</p>
<p>remains platform independent</p>
<p>so now that you know roughly where the</p>
<p>problem is how do you solve it</p>
<p>previously we had log files being</p>
<p>written to the web server</p>
<p>you had to be an administrator log into</p>
<p>that service download the log files and</p>
<p>then view a large text file full of logs</p>
<p>this has issues of accessibility and</p>
<p>security</p>
<p>you can't open access to many people</p>
<p>because of the security constraint</p>
<p>and it's time consuming to get access to</p>
<p>those logs</p>
<p>then once you get them you just see a</p>
<p>wall of text</p>
<p>you don't get any of the benefits of AI</p>
<p>insights anomalies or trending Analytics</p>
<p>you can't see there's been a spike in</p>
<p>latency to a certain endpoint request</p>
<p>or multiple 500 error codes coming back</p>
<p>from another endpoint</p>
<p>your native service provider can't</p>
<p>consume the logs and pair them with</p>
<p>telemetry</p>
<p>information about the infrastructure</p>
<p>service that's running your application</p>
<p>like CPU and RAM</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>so we've done three things in 4.3 we've</p>
<p>added more logging added more context to</p>
<p>that logging and then made those logs</p>
<p>available to services that are optimized</p>
<p>for monitoring and analyzing the data in</p>
<p>those logs</p>
<p>when we say we've added more product</p>
<p>application logging</p>
<p>what this means is that we've increased</p>
<p>the number of messages that are logged</p>
<p>to expose how the product is working</p>
<p>internally</p>
<p>this gives more insight for</p>
<p>troubleshooting Diagnostics and Optima</p>
<p>optimization purposes</p>
<p>where previously an endpoint may have</p>
<p>been receiving a lot of requests</p>
<p>hypothetically recommendations and</p>
<p>taking a long time to process them</p>
<p>this was not visible if the request was</p>
<p>not logged</p>
<p>now that the endpoints are locked it is</p>
<p>visible and allows designers to optimize</p>
<p>how applications and streams are</p>
<p>implemented to improve overall</p>
<p>performance</p>
<p>we've added more context where possible</p>
<p>to each log</p>
<p>so if there's a user ID Associated we</p>
<p>always put the user ID on it</p>
<p>if there's a company ID we always put</p>
<p>the company on it</p>
<p>when you look at the log you have more</p>
<p>context as to which area it relates to</p>
<p>this gives users finer grained</p>
<p>information when named</p>
<p>you can stay with the logs being written</p>
<p>to file on the service</p>
<p>or take advantage of the new feature</p>
<p>logging provider support</p>
<p>to send the output to third-party login</p>
<p>providers like Azure application</p>
<p>insights or datadog or centralized</p>
<p>monitoring analysis</p>
<p>they are specialists in this area and</p>
<p>provide fantastic features for searching</p>
<p>monitoring dashboarding and alerting</p>
<p>for example you could search the logs</p>
<p>for a specific user or recommendation</p>
<p>and we're doing this in an industry</p>
<p>standard way using best practices of a</p>
<p>standard platform independent login</p>
<p>provider logging Library</p>
<p>the benefit is that we can quickly and</p>
<p>easily add support for more providers if</p>
<p>you request one that we don't have</p>
<p>in summary application logging is</p>
<p>essential for troubleshooting and</p>
<p>debugging as it helps identify and</p>
<p>analyze issues that may arise during the</p>
<p>application's execution</p>
<p>it also provides valuable insights into</p>
<p>the application's performance usage</p>
<p>patterns and security</p>
<p>near the end of 2022 we heard feedback</p>
<p>from a customer that the distributed</p>
<p>casing was not working as expected on</p>
<p>AWS</p>
<p>despite scaling up and after resources</p>
<p>some f Pages were slow and some were</p>
<p>timing out</p>
<p>these performance issues were due to the</p>
<p>large volume of data in memory</p>
<p>with the 4.3 release the timeouts have</p>
<p>been fixed across all platforms by</p>
<p>refactoring our implementation of</p>
<p>distributed</p>
<p>we're still using redis or remote</p>
<p>dictionary server a popular open source</p>
<p>data structure store</p>
<p>but we're using it more effectively by</p>
<p>breaking the memory used into smaller</p>
<p>pieces</p>
<p>these are more easily managed by Raiders</p>
<p>to handle larger volumes of memory and</p>
<p>cash faster which is passed on to the</p>
<p>users who experience those faster</p>
<p>response times</p>
<p>data catering is a technique to improve</p>
<p>the performance and responsiveness of</p>
<p>applications</p>
<p>we're frequently accessed data stored in</p>
<p>memory</p>
<p>a fast and easily accessible location</p>
<p>rather than a time-consuming operation</p>
<p>like accessing a data</p>
<p>distributed casing is when it is stored</p>
<p>in an external service accessible by one</p>
<p>or more servers</p>
<p>it is mandatory when you scale out and</p>
<p>run more than one instance of our</p>
<p>product</p>
<p>I'm showing the typical architecture for</p>
<p>AWS but it is the same concept on other</p>
<p>platforms and you can view their typical</p>
<p>architecture on our product</p>
<p>your Cloud native implementation handles</p>
<p>adding Resources by basically cloning</p>
<p>the web service</p>
<p>they're out of the box load balancer</p>
<p>such as AWS elastic Beanstalk or Azure</p>
<p>app service determines which web service</p>
<p>the user's browser connects to as soon</p>
<p>as you scale out</p>
<p>between different browsers and stream</p>
<p>hosts talk to any of the web server</p>
<p>instances the cache data must give the</p>
<p>same result</p>
<p>in the example of an app page that is</p>
<p>initially loaded</p>
<p>everyone will see the same published app</p>
<p>page because it's saved in the database</p>
<p>when someone edits that app page in</p>
<p>order for every other user to see those</p>
<p>changes near real time</p>
<p>those changes must be stored somewhere</p>
<p>in memory that all the servers server</p>
<p>instances access</p>
<p>with distributed caching we move that</p>
<p>in-memory data out of the individual web</p>
<p>servers and into readers</p>
<p>the end result is that the web server</p>
<p>instances all access the same memory</p>
<p>allowing the clients connected to the</p>
<p>different servers to see those changes</p>
<p>in year real time too</p>
<p>there's a lot of functionality in our</p>
<p>product that uses cache data</p>
<p>for example streaming data from a stream</p>
<p>host or multiple stream hosts connecting</p>
<p>to application designer where the stream</p>
<p>hosts our clients as well</p>
<p>the main reason for scaling is</p>
<p>performance</p>
<p>for example if the CPU was high for data</p>
<p>streams and you had many streams running</p>
<p>you could scale up by increasing the app</p>
<p>service plan in Azure but there is a</p>
<p>limit to how high you can go</p>
<p>this is when you would scale out to get</p>
<p>more CPU</p>
<p>so one reason is for performance to</p>
<p>scale up and out</p>
<p>the second reason is resiliency</p>
<p>for example if you had data stream</p>
<p>designer on Azure app service plan 2 and</p>
<p>it had an issue with a performance was</p>
<p>deprecated for some reason users would</p>
<p>be locked out</p>
<p>however if you had two instances at a</p>
<p>lower service plan and one of those had</p>
<p>an issue that caused performance to be</p>
<p>degraded the users would be able to</p>
<p>continue to use the product on the</p>
<p>second instance</p>
<p>so resiliency is another Factor</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>the third benefit is costs</p>
<p>technically you can Auto scale out an</p>
<p>inner gain automatically or on a</p>
<p>schedule to better manage your</p>
<p>infrastructure costs in Peak periods</p>
<p>early benchmarking results indicate that</p>
<p>using distributed caching has</p>
<p>performance improvements even when you</p>
<p>are running only one instance of the</p>
<p>product and so is something you may want</p>
<p>to consider switching to for larger</p>
<p>production ready implementations</p>
<p>such as those with a large number of</p>
<p>data streams</p>
<p>once more</p>
<p>we have two complementary features from</p>
<p>a pillar included in 4.3 this time for</p>
<p>AI and Engineering intelligence</p>
<p>neither a data scientist nor a designer</p>
<p>wants to create a model in one</p>
<p>environment and manually load them into</p>
<p>Data stream designer each time they</p>
<p>change</p>
<p>it's in Pro notebook provides data</p>
<p>scientists with the ability to work</p>
<p>within the XM pro products Suite to</p>
<p>create models using scientific computing</p>
<p>and our mlflow agent enables effective</p>
<p>model governance to run the production</p>
<p>model version against live event data in</p>
<p>a data stream</p>
<p>we'll end off with the significant</p>
<p>performance improvements to the time</p>
<p>series chart block</p>
<p>enabling quicker data retrieval for</p>
<p>longer periods</p>
<p>exim Pro notebook is a new product</p>
<p>released for freemium in 4.3</p>
<p>existing customers and premium users can</p>
<p>contact us for access</p>
<p>and Licensing options</p>
<p>this is an embedded Jupiter notebook</p>
<p>providing a familiar interface for data</p>
<p>science scientific Computing and machine</p>
<p>learning</p>
<p>data scientists analysts and Engineers</p>
<p>will be able to access data to innovate</p>
<p>within the XM Pro Suite</p>
<p>we've added built-in chat GPT</p>
<p>functionality to help you in the process</p>
<p>for example you can ask it to create</p>
<p>code to represent data in a certain</p>
<p>visualization</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>when you're done you can save the file</p>
<p>and execute it using our python agent as</p>
<p>embedded AI</p>
<p>or you can apply governance</p>
<p>leverage the mlflow library to commit</p>
<p>the model to your repository right from</p>
<p>within X in Pro notebook</p>
<p>for use in a data stream</p>
<p>this was just a small test of XM Pro</p>
<p>notebook</p>
<p>in last month's webinar Gavin Green</p>
<p>presented a Hands-On demonstration of AI</p>
<p>in intelligent digital twins which is a</p>
<p>fully extended version that explains</p>
<p>these features and more in detail it is</p>
<p>well worth watching</p>
<p>moving on to ml flow</p>
<p>as AI scales within the organization</p>
<p>corporate guard rails require AI to be</p>
<p>modeled within an ml Ops framework</p>
<p>you don't want to end up with models</p>
<p>stored in a variety of places and lose</p>
<p>track of which is the latest version or</p>
<p>where it is located</p>
<p>ml flow agent is the first in a series</p>
<p>that enables effective model governance</p>
<p>using a popular ml Ops toolset</p>
<p>let us know if you are using a different</p>
<p>Repository</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>this empowers data scientists to promote</p>
<p>new model versions within mlflow without</p>
<p>going back to edit the data stream</p>
<p>let's see this in action</p>
<p>my thanks to Chris for recording this</p>
<p>demo</p>
<p>as soon as I find my mouse</p>
<p>in it we have an mlflow agent configured</p>
<p>to use version one of a model called</p>
<p>wine quality</p>
<p>once the data stream is published</p>
<p>observe that the first event confirms</p>
<p>model version 1 was used to make a</p>
<p>prediction</p>
<p>now we'll change over to ml flow</p>
<p>and promote version 2 to production</p>
<p>going back to the data stream without</p>
<p>reconfiguring or republishing observe</p>
<p>that model version 2 is seamlessly used</p>
<p>to make the next prediction</p>
<p>application designers time series chart</p>
<p>or TSC is one of our most popular data</p>
<p>visualizations</p>
<p>however we found that performance is not</p>
<p>satisfactory with large volumes of data</p>
<p>and as you know this is usually the case</p>
<p>with time series data</p>
<p>all relevant data is returned to the</p>
<p>client for processing so that it doesn't</p>
<p>need to be refreshed</p>
<p>unless certain parameters are changed</p>
<p>but large volumes of data are slow to</p>
<p>return and slow to process on the client</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>we've made changes to the block itself</p>
<p>and released a specialized TSC connector</p>
<p>that only Returns the data points</p>
<p>displayed on that chart the block sends</p>
<p>the requested parameters to the</p>
<p>connector which retrieves the data from</p>
<p>the data source punches the numbers and</p>
<p>sends back only the data actually</p>
<p>displayed</p>
<p>for example rather than sending 60 000</p>
<p>records for 180 buckets we're only</p>
<p>returning 180 records</p>
<p>this results in a fast and scalable user</p>
<p>experience</p>
<p>the disadvantage of this approach is</p>
<p>that it is repeated every time the chart</p>
<p>is Interactive such as zooming or</p>
<p>changing the asset selection</p>
<p>a TSC SQL connector is available now</p>
<p>and the functionality will be rolled out</p>
<p>for Azure data Explorer and historian</p>
<p>next</p>
<p>you will need the 4.3 release for The</p>
<p>Block enhancement and thereafter simply</p>
<p>load the new connectors as they are made</p>
<p>available</p>
<p>alternatively you can continue using the</p>
<p>original connectors for smaller data</p>
<p>volumes to avoid the load between</p>
<p>interactions</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>have a demo by Dragon another one of our</p>
<p>talented developers of the new connector</p>
<p>in action</p>
<p>we discovered during a trial run through</p>
<p>that my audio is not going to play or</p>
<p>the audio of the video is not going to</p>
<p>play through from you so</p>
<p>this is my first run through with the</p>
<p>script so let's just see how that goes</p>
<p>when we play the video</p>
<p>this is the new TSC SQL connector</p>
<p>which pulling the selected fields that</p>
<p>we have for this time range</p>
<p>and this interval size</p>
<p>we can see that the request was</p>
<p>returning in less than 400 milliseconds</p>
<p>and the size is 44 45 kilobytes</p>
<p>if I open the request now we can see</p>
<p>that we have 179 records or buckets and</p>
<p>for each packet we have the selected</p>
<p>field with their corresponding Min and</p>
<p>Max values that are actually showing on</p>
<p>this one</p>
<p>now what we've said is if we move the</p>
<p>range it's going to send a new request</p>
<p>the same size in the same time</p>
<p>if we move the range</p>
<p>sorry if we increase or decrease the</p>
<p>interval size we should have double the</p>
<p>buckets</p>
<p>Sarah do we have any questions</p>
<p>thanks very much Kim and thank you</p>
<p>everyone for joining us uh yes we've got</p>
<p>one question here about uh where can we</p>
<p>find some more information on 4.3 or any</p>
<p>other release</p>
<p>I would encourage you to go to our</p>
<p>product documentation and look at both</p>
