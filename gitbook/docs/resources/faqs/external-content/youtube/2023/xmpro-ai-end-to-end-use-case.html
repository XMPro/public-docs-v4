<summary>Transcript</summary>hello everyone welcome to this webinar
<p>on an end-to-end Solution by example my</p>
<p>name is John Van hedden I'm part of the</p>
<p>Strategic Solutions team as an engineer</p>
<p>so today we'll be talking around the</p>
<p>exam Pro AI part of our four pillars of</p>
<p>X and Pro</p>
<p>uh that's this guy right here</p>
<p>and it is a distributed intelligence</p>
<p>that is achieved through AI engineering</p>
<p>where people and Technology meet to</p>
<p>innovate execute and augment with AI</p>
<p>uh so I'll just note as well we are</p>
<p>currently in our XM Pro notebook here so</p>
<p>it is part of our suite of applications</p>
<p>that's this guy here</p>
<p>and we'll step into our end-to-end</p>
<p>solution example</p>
<p>so going through this end-to-end</p>
<p>solution we will Define over the pro go</p>
<p>through the problem definition</p>
<p>look at some of the related data the</p>
<p>characteristics of that data visualize</p>
<p>the data identify what is um</p>
<p>the suit more suitable machine learning</p>
<p>models that we might use develop these</p>
<p>models all within the notebook</p>
<p>and then we'll step into the deployment</p>
<p>of uh sending these models to our data</p>
<p>streams</p>
<p>running live data through them</p>
<p>getting some results</p>
<p>pushing that up to applications to</p>
<p>recommendations and also touch on how to</p>
<p>manage your models</p>
<p>so looking at the problem definition for</p>
<p>this example</p>
<p>we have a subject matter expert that has</p>
<p>multiple pumps in remote areas</p>
<p>this subject matter expert wants to</p>
<p>analyze some sensor data and we actually</p>
<p>have a lot of sense of data I think</p>
<p>plus 50 50 plus sensors and the goal for</p>
<p>this subject matter expert is to be able</p>
<p>to identify which pumps are likely to</p>
<p>fail and estimate their remaining use of</p>
<p>life</p>
<p>the key for this subject matter expert</p>
<p>is to be able to create prioritize and</p>
<p>create a maintenance schedule</p>
<p>ultimately reducing the optimal downtime</p>
<p>as the key Focus</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>breaking this up into the components we</p>
<p>can see that we have a need for a</p>
<p>classification model for being able to</p>
<p>identify pumps that are likely to fail</p>
<p>and a regression model for the</p>
<p>estimating riding use of life and we'll</p>
<p>be stepping through that part</p>
<p>um at first through our uh stepping</p>
<p>through data analysis first to get to</p>
<p>those two models</p>
<p>so the Crux of this problem is that we</p>
<p>need the right people at the right place</p>
<p>at the right time</p>
<p>the data analysis part</p>
<p>utilizes our data streams to bring in</p>
<p>our data and our example notebook to do</p>
<p>the analysis so this is a Jupiter</p>
<p>notebook style notebook so it's very</p>
<p>familiar to data scientists and</p>
<p>Engineers who commonly use this platform</p>
<p>so stepping into the data analysis we'll</p>
<p>be loading in our data so this data is</p>
<p>coming from our data streams so</p>
<p>if I click into this guide here</p>
<p>where we have a listener so we have a</p>
<p>set of a whole bunch of listeners in our</p>
<p>toolbox this is</p>
<p>XM Pros set you can also build your own</p>
<p>through our extended school library</p>
<p>so you can bring in any types of</p>
<p>live data like mgtt your OPC UA</p>
<p>Etc we can then filter some invalid data</p>
<p>points out so if your sensors go offline</p>
<p>we might not want to bring that into our</p>
<p>model and we can choose to write this to</p>
<p>a set of</p>
<p>action agents is what we call them a set</p>
<p>of data storages so we also have a wide</p>
<p>array of choices here</p>
<p>in this example we'll be choosing just</p>
<p>to write it to CSV and pull it into our</p>
<p>notebook</p>
<p>put the data now in our notebook we can</p>
<p>go through</p>
<p>extensive or basic in this example basic</p>
<p>analysis looking at some of the</p>
<p>characteristics looking at the the top</p>
<p>top 10 rows of data summarizing our data</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>something to note about this data as</p>
<p>well is from our maintenance system</p>
<p>we've now labeled this data with our</p>
<p>machine status so we can see that</p>
<p>there's a there's three states normal</p>
<p>broken issue so ideally we want to</p>
<p>identify these issue States for our</p>
<p>classification model</p>
<p>yeah</p>
<p>the next step is to visualize our data</p>
<p>get a good idea of</p>
<p>how our data relates to each other since</p>
<p>we have a lot of sensors we're going to</p>
<p>push our data to a principal component</p>
<p>analysis space that brings it down to</p>
<p>two dimensions that's a different</p>
<p>transformation of the data for us to</p>
<p>visualize and identify clusters for our</p>
<p>classification</p>
<p>so here is the code for for visualizing</p>
<p>the data so there's just a contour plot</p>
<p>with the principle component space and</p>
<p>here's our results so we've got a nice</p>
<p>interactive uh</p>
<p>plots here I've got a console plot on</p>
<p>the right side and and a</p>
<p>density Contour on the on the left side</p>
<p>and if we actually just pull away all</p>
<p>our normal points we can see there's a</p>
<p>nice clustering of our issue</p>
<p>issue States and where we find our</p>
<p>machine breaks down</p>
<p>so we can see that there's significant</p>
<p>groupings for the issue States closely</p>
<p>related to the broken States and this is</p>
<p>a nice indication for us that this could</p>
<p>be suitable for our classification of</p>
<p>course we can go a lot deeper into this</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>look look at a deeper analysis and</p>
<p>Transformations on this data but this is</p>
<p>just a simple example</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>please also take note that this type of</p>
<p>data that works really well is not it's</p>
<p>not always viable it depends on the data</p>
<p>characteristics and how we transform the</p>
<p>data how we clean the data how we bring</p>
<p>uh do feature engineering Etc</p>
<p>so now that we've had a nice idea look</p>
<p>at our data we've got a good idea of</p>
<p>what we're working with we're jumping</p>
<p>into our development of our two models</p>
<p>so this will be achieved through our</p>
<p>data streams so this is where we keep</p>
<p>bringing in that data and our notebook</p>
<p>that we're in currently</p>
<p>so the first step classification</p>
<p>classification of the at-risk pumps</p>
<p>choosing a model that's uh up to you so</p>
<p>I'm choosing a random Forest classifier</p>
<p>typically someone might start off with</p>
<p>something that's that's very basic or</p>
<p>use an automl library is optimized your</p>
<p>model selection and the hyper parameter</p>
<p>tuning it gives you a good starting</p>
<p>block so this one will just be a vanilla</p>
<p>random Forest classifier nothing too</p>
<p>special in the hyper parameters just</p>
<p>something that gets us nice basic clean</p>
<p>results</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>this is the code that does the</p>
<p>classification we do a test train split</p>
<p>for for our data that we've now pulled</p>
<p>out of we're using our data data streams</p>
<p>into that CSV</p>
<p>and we run this classification model and</p>
<p>we look at some of the evaluation</p>
<p>metrics and we can see it's actually got</p>
<p>a very very nice score broken it doesn't</p>
<p>have uh there's not many cases we've got</p>
<p>heavy class in Balance there and we're</p>
<p>not too wide we are we would like to</p>
<p>know that there's a good distinction</p>
<p>between our issue cases and normal so</p>
<p>this gives us great results for for that</p>
<p>in the accounting that this model will</p>
<p>do a good job at classifying our at-risk</p>
<p>pumps</p>
<p>so once we've created these models we</p>
<p>can now save the model files and use</p>
<p>them into our data streams which I'll</p>
<p>show ahead on the deployment stage</p>
<p>so this is our classification model we</p>
<p>can now jump into our regression model</p>
<p>so we've now taken our data</p>
<p>and creating these two models uh to</p>
<p>bring into our example application</p>
<p>Fuller regression model what I've done</p>
<p>here is I've just uh in this first block</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>created a calculation to identify the</p>
<p>number of hours until the next broken</p>
<p>time</p>
<p>and in the second part similar to the</p>
<p>first I've chosen just a gradient</p>
<p>boosting regressor just a Model A very</p>
<p>basic I have a testing train split and</p>
<p>I've run this and it got some evaluation</p>
<p>metrics at the end here again very nice</p>
<p>scores on on for this data set so we can</p>
<p>see that there are squared score is is</p>
<p>above 0.9 which is very a very good</p>
<p>indication so we can see this will give</p>
<p>us a nice uh prediction for the</p>
<p>remaining use of life</p>
<p>once again you save these model files</p>
<p>you know just recap on that one</p>
<p>so for the deployment stage we now have</p>
<p>our models and</p>
<p>we will want our subject matter expert</p>
<p>to be able to interact with these models</p>
<p>so I'll click through here</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>sorry where this slide</p>
<p>so this is what we have at the moment so</p>
<p>we have our two models and we've brought</p>
<p>that in from our data</p>
<p>now we want to be able to apply live</p>
<p>data to these models and surface this to</p>
<p>a interface that our subject matter</p>
<p>expert can open up on is a laptop</p>
<p>wherever he's at</p>
<p>DLC</p>
<p>um so looking at the problem definition</p>
<p>we've got our models but we would now</p>
<p>like to create the maintenance schedule</p>
<p>and start getting value out of these</p>
<p>models</p>
<p>your deployment options are wide and uh</p>
<p>there are many options available through</p>
<p>XM Pro</p>
<p>there might be various reasons why you</p>
<p>might need Edge for for computational</p>
<p>Speed or security cloud or a hybrid and</p>
<p>we've got a range of methods to to apply</p>
<p>these models and um</p>
<p>and so as our entire set of data streams</p>
<p>can be configured</p>
<p>through through these options</p>
<p>so taking our models we will now put</p>
<p>them into our data stream</p>
<p>and we're actually going to model change</p>
<p>these models until you save on some</p>
<p>computational power if needed apply live</p>
<p>data to them</p>
<p>and this live data will then</p>
<p>um the results from this live data will</p>
<p>now go into our recommendation engine</p>
<p>and also surface into our application uh</p>
<p>giving us insights and and of for event</p>
<p>intelligence</p>
<p>so I will just open up our data streams</p>
<p>and recommendations</p>
<p>and applications just to show how the</p>
<p>three</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>gel into each other</p>
<p>so in our data stream</p>
<p>this is where we now we are now applying</p>
<p>our two models so we're using the python</p>
<p>agent here and</p>
<p>we've got our model scripts in there</p>
<p>and we can point this to any python</p>
<p>instance we like so if we want to go</p>
<p>execute this on the GPU we can set that</p>
<p>up</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>this is the other model there</p>
<p>so how this data stream works is we</p>
<p>bring in our live data</p>
<p>we prepare our Json package it goes into</p>
<p>our first at-risk pump classifier this</p>
<p>will give us a true or a sorry a normal</p>
<p>or issue classification so I'm just</p>
<p>looking at the live viewer here this is</p>
<p>just primarily used for for visualizing</p>
<p>what's going on here it's not our main</p>
<p>point of</p>
<p>of analysis</p>
<p>just to get the the flows working so</p>
<p>this data is coming through we'll be</p>
<p>waiting for a data set to come through</p>
<p>now so we can see we've got some some</p>
<p>data come in</p>
<p>uh we've got a range of sensor values</p>
<p>and it's gone into our model and we've</p>
<p>got a normal result so</p>
<p>at this point here</p>
<p>the normal result gets filtered out and</p>
<p>that's the end of that</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>of that</p>
<p>set of data</p>
<p>the model the the data points that</p>
<p>identified as a fault or their sort of</p>
<p>issue they go into our prediction</p>
<p>remaining use of Life model this will</p>
<p>now on that app on that pump give us our</p>
<p>remaining use of life</p>
<p>we extract our asset name and then we</p>
<p>broadcast this to our recommendations</p>
<p>and our application our recommendations</p>
<p>so that we can write some rules for um</p>
<p>for some events intelligence alerts and</p>
<p>our applications so that we can</p>
<p>visualize the type of data that's coming</p>
<p>through</p>
<p>here's our recommendations so</p>
<p>this is a recommendation rule I've set</p>
<p>up called pump at risk</p>
<p>I've added one rule here for the</p>
<p>remaining use of life</p>
<p>and in my alert headline I can</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>push live data into this alert headline</p>
<p>so from a glance you can see how many</p>
<p>hours it has left</p>
<p>uh I've created a set of</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>alert description so this rule is around</p>
<p>if I have a pump that has a remaining</p>
<p>use of Life less than 100 hours so these</p>
<p>are the ones that maybe I have a couple</p>
<p>of pumps that have a certain level of</p>
<p>urgency but these ones are imminent</p>
<p>failure critical risk</p>
<p>so I've set this as a high ranking and</p>
<p>the rule said for this recommendation is</p>
<p>when this remaining use of life is less</p>
<p>than a hundred</p>
<p>I can now add additional triage</p>
<p>instructions and information around this</p>
<p>recommendation and I'll show you how the</p>
<p>this configuration surfaces in the</p>
<p>application as well</p>
<p>so clicking into application what we</p>
<p>have here is we've got an interactive</p>
<p>map on the left hand side here</p>
<p>a list of our Assets in a table and</p>
<p>these recommendation rules that have</p>
<p>come up from our recommendation we've</p>
<p>set up so also note here that we can</p>
<p>we can set up</p>
<p>notifications for this recommendation as</p>
<p>well for more uh specific</p>
<p>uh urgent for more urgent action so we</p>
<p>can set this up as</p>
<p>soon as the basic name</p>
<p>and we can</p>
<p>send this out to the email or SMS</p>
<p>coming back to application so here we</p>
<p>have our list of pumps so this data is</p>
<p>getting fed live from our data stream</p>
<p>and we can see here we've got a remote</p>
<p>location very remote uh potentially</p>
<p>requires a helicopter for this type of</p>
<p>servicing and we can identify just</p>
<p>visually our issue pumps and how many</p>
<p>how the remaining use of Life on them</p>
<p>so I can now zoom in here and just uh</p>
<p>this by visual inspections can start</p>
<p>doing my scheduling and mapping out</p>
<p>there so looking at the recommendations</p>
<p>that I get for these at-risk files</p>
<p>I can now click into a recommendation</p>
<p>so this is the recommendation we set up</p>
<p>in the previous configuration</p>
<p>and I can look at some of the the event</p>
<p>data coming through so I can see okay</p>
<p>I've got 94 hours left on this guy this</p>
<p>is a critical one</p>
<p>um I can start writing notes on on this</p>
<p>pump and</p>
<p>uh submitting work requests</p>
<p>my maintenance crew can now go to this</p>
<p>pump</p>
<p>follow some triage instructions</p>
<p>uh looking at how to diagnose this pump</p>
<p>and how what is the best course of</p>
<p>action</p>
<p>we can build a discussion around this</p>
<p>pump uh look at a timeline of</p>
<p>what has been done to this</p>
<p>recommendation</p>
<p>look through some analytics for this</p>
<p>specific recommendation so if we see</p>
<p>this pump continually it has a low</p>
<p>remaining use of Life there may be a</p>
<p>persistent issue there</p>
<p>after we've resolved our issue we've</p>
<p>done our diagonal</p>
<p>excuse me</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>analysis on the diagnosis on the pump</p>
<p>and we've amended an issue or identified</p>
<p>the issue we can come down to the bottom</p>
<p>here</p>
<p>and we can either mark this uh pump as</p>
<p>resolved or mark it as a false positive</p>
<p>and this can then come back into our</p>
<p>data set and for a refraining and</p>
<p>refining our models</p>
<p>so that's a very nice feature there</p>
<p>so from point of view from our subject</p>
<p>matter expert</p>
<p>we want to open up our laptop in the</p>
<p>morning after our of our coffee or tea</p>
<p>and we come to this map here</p>
<p>and now we can have a look in look at</p>
<p>our pumps set up our scheduling</p>
<p>and this might be manual for this first</p>
<p>instance and I'll show you just in a</p>
<p>second how we can bring optimization</p>
<p>into this and we can keep iterating on</p>
<p>this application as as our as our models</p>
<p>become more refined and advanced so just</p>
<p>going into the edit mode for this</p>
<p>application we see we've got a range</p>
<p>similar to our data streams we also have</p>
<p>a toolbox for our visualization elements</p>
<p>so I can bring in something like a</p>
<p>calendar</p>
<p>rearrange and adjust my layout as well</p>
<p>as additionally creating template pages</p>
<p>and additional pages that I can drill</p>
<p>down into so I can dive into specific</p>
<p>assets</p>
<p>I'll just cancel that one</p>
<p>fantastic so this is uh what I've shown</p>
<p>here so we've got our two models from</p>
<p>before we've brought them into our data</p>
<p>stream here</p>
<p>and um we're we're pushing that data</p>
<p>through we've got our chained models so</p>
<p>that only the at-risk pumps go through</p>
<p>for prediction or remaining use of life</p>
<p>and we surface this all the way to our</p>
<p>application uh let's start up again</p>
<p>our application here where we also have</p>
<p>alerts set up for remaining use of Life</p>
<p>less than 100 hours for our more</p>
<p>critical events</p>
<p>so on top of this now I can bring in a</p>
<p>scheduling model similar to my machine</p>
<p>learning models I can go and bring in</p>
<p>any type of Library I I require to set</p>
<p>up the scheduling optimization problem</p>
<p>I can go through with real data I can</p>
<p>store some real data look at some of my</p>
<p>maybe I've gone and created a few manual</p>
<p>scheduling</p>
<p>sheets I bring all that in I can analyze</p>
<p>it I can bring it into this and compare</p>
<p>it with this algorithm see if I get any</p>
<p>get a performance boost</p>
<p>and uh so so this is the process of</p>
<p>going through developing this or tools</p>
<p>model</p>
<p>uh it's just a constraint solver</p>
<p>and at the end I get some results out</p>
<p>for okay if I need to travel to my six</p>
<p>most critical pumps this would be my</p>
<p>um optimal route and it gives me a</p>
<p>distance metric for for this so in in a</p>
<p>similar fashion as what I've brought in</p>
<p>my machine learning models I can now</p>
<p>bring in that model through through a</p>
<p>python agent as an example that's very</p>
<p>as aforementioned there's a few</p>
<p>different options you can choose I might</p>
<p>bring that in here</p>
<p>and then from my list of pumps</p>
<p>I can tie that in and then from there on</p>
<p>out I can take that schedule and present</p>
<p>it boil it up here so I've got an</p>
<p>automated schedule that reacts to live</p>
<p>data so every time I get a new live data</p>
<p>point in and I might set it up to wait</p>
<p>for every every hour before running uh</p>
<p>my scheduling model</p>
<p>but I've got an hourly updated live</p>
<p>scheduling that I can access by just</p>
<p>opening my laptop</p>
<p>so the last Point here on the end</p>
<p>into in use cases the management so</p>
<p>now that I've</p>
<p>gone through and I've developed my</p>
<p>machine learning models and the benefit</p>
<p>the beauty of of using these notebooks</p>
<p>and and getting your data in with XM the</p>
<p>data streams is that I can iterate</p>
<p>quickly on these models I can get</p>
<p>results quickly I've got graphical</p>
<p>interface files I don't have to do</p>
<p>mappings to to extensive mappings to get</p>
<p>a point solution uh visible on a page</p>
<p>and usable</p>
<p>um I can iterate quickly on these on</p>
<p>these models and then I step into my</p>
<p>refinement process and this performance</p>
<p>process can can lead to very complex</p>
<p>models so that may be in my optimization</p>
<p>model or my two machine learning models</p>
<p>and this is where management comes in to</p>
<p>to look at some of the uh sorry about</p>
<p>slides kicking up</p>
<p>to look at some</p>
<p>some management options like a model</p>
<p>registry so some benefits getting in</p>
<p>some metadata of the models the lineage</p>
<p>versions I can put models into</p>
<p>production uh I can I can iterate on</p>
<p>these models add annotations and all</p>
<p>this type this type of um</p>
<p>extra information about the model that's</p>
<p>not just a set of a file with weighted</p>
<p>values in there so if I go back to my</p>
<p>data Stream So an option of of this is</p>
<p>ml flow</p>
<p>we've got a right a wide range and</p>
<p>there's a set of options you can choose</p>
<p>so the example there would be that</p>
<p>I have my model repository sitting here</p>
<p>in place of where I've execute my model</p>
<p>here I can select my model so I might</p>
<p>have version 10 running and I push my</p>
<p>live data through and I get it all</p>
<p>surfaced up to here and I've got a team</p>
<p>working hard in the in the basement and</p>
<p>they're working on the next the greatest</p>
<p>best model with some brand new data and</p>
<p>they've upgraded this to version three I</p>
<p>can click into this save it to version</p>
<p>three and it automatically comes into</p>
<p>this through this data stream</p>
<p>so this is the end-to-end solution for</p>
<p>this specific example where we've</p>
<p>defined our problem</p>
<p>we've identified what kind of models are</p>
<p>required what kind of actions would the</p>
<p>subject matter expert</p>
<p>how they would interact with this</p>
<p>application</p>
<p>we've looked at our data this has come</p>
<p>from our data streams so we've got live</p>
<p>data we've stored it's in some storage</p>
<p>and we've then looked at the</p>
<p>characteristics of this data we've</p>
<p>transformed it into into a different</p>
<p>space the PCA space and visualized it in</p>
<p>a 2d way so we can identify those</p>
<p>clusters</p>
<p>we've then stepped into our development</p>
<p>so that's looking at developing our two</p>
<p>machine learning models looking at their</p>
<p>results the metrics that come from them</p>
<p>and getting an idea of whether they're</p>
<p>suitable for the task and it it will be</p>
<p>dependent on your task if you have</p>
<p>something that's more at risk something</p>
<p>with the that it may have a lot of false</p>
<p>positives may not be well made good so</p>
<p>we do all these kind of decisions here</p>
<p>at this stage there and then we step</p>
<p>into our deployment of how do we get</p>
<p>this into the streams where do we want</p>
<p>this to run what kind of security do we</p>
<p>need do we</p>
<p>do we need this at the edge is it highly</p>
<p>computational those types of questions</p>
<p>then we look at</p>
<p>taking our resulting models getting into</p>
<p>a management system and continually</p>
<p>iterating back on so once we've got to</p>
<p>end of one stage we've got some good</p>
<p>results we might have a bit of feedback</p>
<p>from our subject matter expert that will</p>
<p>tell us this is not quite how this works</p>
<p>this model gives us too many false</p>
<p>positives</p>
<p>Etc</p>
<p>we go through we redefine our problem</p>
<p>um well we enhance our problem we bring</p>
<p>in some new data might need to bring in</p>
<p>some more</p>
<p>different variables that will account</p>
<p>for some variants in our in our</p>
<p>resulting data</p>
<p>um go through the development we might</p>
<p>use Auto ml we might actually now hyper</p>
<p>parameters the data might change so</p>
<p>there's a there's a set of different uh</p>
<p>there there's a lot of variance through</p>
<p>this process and that's why it makes it</p>
<p>such a benefit to have a fast iterative</p>
<p>process through these Excel Pro</p>
<p>notebooks and</p>
<p>and we stepped through all the way</p>
<p>again back to deploying these models</p>
<p>getting them through building up our</p>
<p>application</p>
<p>uh creating maybe potentially some drill</p>
<p>Downs where we get to the pump level and</p>
<p>we might look at the the pump data</p>
<p>visualizing that directly at the pump</p>
<p>from this um</p>
<p>interface and we can even step this</p>
<p>further back into looking at maybe I</p>
<p>have for each state I've got a set of</p>
<p>pumps and I want to look at the set of</p>
<p>pumps for those States</p>
<p>and I can allocate a person to to look</p>
<p>at a unique page that's focused purely</p>
<p>on in territory for example</p>
<p>okay thanks very much Sean um we've just</p>
<p>got a few questions that have popped in</p>
<p>during the session</p>
<p>um so the first one is why and when</p>
<p>would you use the python agent rather</p>
<p>than Jupiter notebook</p>
<p>yes so the</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so the python agent would be if you have</p>
<p>a pre-existing solution or you have a</p>
<p>very simple type of</p>
<p>a script that needs to be needs to run</p>
<p>or maybe a library that just takes in</p>
<p>data uh your notebooks is is a lot</p>
<p>around investigating uh visualizing uh</p>
<p>all on a common common platform that</p>
<p>that everyone on your team has the</p>
<p>um the same set of libraries you can</p>
<p>share the notebooks so this is a</p>
<p>collaborative type</p>
<p>process here</p>
<p>um so that yeah that would be the reason</p>
<p>why</p>
<p>where so so the results from from this</p>
<p>notebook investigation it ends up being</p>
<p>a python script that you bring into this</p>
<p>to this agent here</p>
<p>awesome and just one other one I've got</p>
<p>time for one more question does it</p>
<p>support decoupling of development</p>
<p>platform versus deployment platform to</p>
<p>be different providers for example if</p>
<p>deployment is on AWS slash Azure while</p>
<p>development is on X and pro platform</p>
<p>yes yes so they um so it would</p>
<p>um it depends on</p>
<p>um what the setup is but that's uh</p>
<p>if sorry can I get that the last part of</p>
<p>that question against you yeah so</p>
<p>um can you just support decoupling of</p>
<p>development platform versus deployment</p>
<p>platform so can it be on different</p>
<p>providers for example deployment is on</p>
<p>AWS and development is on XM Pro</p>
<p>yes that's right yes yes so you you can</p>
<p>go into you can go and deploy uh sorry</p>
<p>develop your models uh anywhere and uh</p>
<p>you through our extensible library you</p>
<p>can also build agents to even interact</p>
<p>with those um</p>
<p>deployment points depending on if if</p>
<p>they can actually serve models for</p>
<p>example</p>
<p>um but that's uh that's 100 viable to to</p>
<p>go and create and develop somewhere else</p>
<p>and bring it into our data streams um</p>
<p>separately</p>
<p>excellent um okay well with that's all</p>
<p>the time we have for questions today um</p>
<p>thanks very much Sean and thanks</p>
<p>everyone for joining us today uh if</p>
<p>you're looking for more information you</p>
<p>can contact Sean or our team directly</p>
<p>and we'll send out the recording of this</p>
<p>this session shortly</p>
<p>um join us next month as we share how to</p>
<p>accelerate your digital twin use cases</p>
<p>with our blueprint accelerators and</p>
<p>patterns repository and you can register</p>
<p>um via these links in the chat box</p>
<p>um here and we look forward to seeing</p>
<p>you all next month thanks very much</p>
<p>everyone</p>
<p>thank you everyone</p>
<p>foreign</p>
