<p>In today's video, we delve into the mechanics and advantages of Distributed Caching in cloud-native applications, specifically focusing on its crucial role when scaling out server instances. This discussion is designed for engineers, architects, and experts who require in-depth understanding rather than surface-level insights.</p>
<p>Key Takeaways: Fundamentals of Data Caching: A brief overview of how data caching improves application performance by storing data in quick-access memory rather than relying on time-consuming database queries.</p>
<p>Architecture: We explore how the typical architecture for AWS mirrors that of other cloud platforms like Azure, particularly in the role of load balancers such as AWS Elastic Beanstalk and Azure App Service.</p>
<p>Cache Consistency: Understand why maintaining cache data consistency across various server instances is vital, especially in a scaled-out architecture.</p>
<p>Practical Use Cases: We discuss real-world scenarios like streaming data from multiple hosts and the influence of caching on application designers.</p>
<p>Scaling: Learn about two primary dimensionsâ€”vertical scaling (scale up) for performance improvement and horizontal scaling (scale out) for added resiliency and meeting high-demand situations.</p>
<p>Resiliency and Redundancy: We illustrate how having multiple server instances can protect against performance degradation, thus ensuring a more robust application environment.</p>
<p>Cost-Effectiveness: Discover how to use auto-scaling strategies to optimize infrastructure costs without sacrificing performance.</p>
<p>Early benchmarking data indicates noticeable performance improvements when using Distributed Caching, even on a single-instance setup. This video aims to provide you with the comprehensive knowledge needed to make informed decisions on implementing Distributed Caching in your cloud-native applications.</p>
<p>Whether you're looking to improve performance, add resiliency, or manage costs, understanding the nuances of Distributed Caching can provide the edge your applications need.</p>

<p>data catering is a technique to improve</p>
<p>the performance and responsiveness of</p>
<p>applications where frequently Access</p>
<p>Data stored in memory</p>
<p>a fast and easily accessible location</p>
<p>rather than a time-consuming operation</p>
<p>like accessing a database</p>
<p>distributed casing is when it is stored</p>
<p>in an external service accessible by one</p>
<p>or more servers</p>
<p>it is mandatory when you scale out and</p>
<p>run more than one instance of our</p>
<p>product</p>
<p>I'm showing the typical architecture for</p>
<p>AWS but it is the same concept on other</p>
<p>platforms and you can view their typical</p>
<p>architecture on our product</p>
<p>your Cloud native implementation handles</p>
<p>adding Resources by basically cloning</p>
<p>the web service</p>
<p>they're out of the box load balancer</p>
<p>such as AWS elastic Beanstalk or Azure</p>
<p>app service determines which web service</p>
<p>the user's browser connects to as soon</p>
<p>as you scale out</p>
<p>between different browsers and stream</p>
<p>hosts talk to any of the web server</p>
<p>instances the cache data must give the</p>
<p>same result</p>
<p>in the example of an app page that is</p>
<p>initially loaded</p>
<p>everyone will see the same published app</p>
<p>page because it's saved in the database</p>
<p>when someone edits that app page in</p>
<p>order for every other user to see those</p>
<p>changes near real time</p>
<p>those changes must be stored somewhere</p>
<p>in memory that all the servers server</p>
<p>instances access</p>
<p>with distributed caching we move that</p>
<p>in-memory data out of the individual web</p>
<p>servers and into readers</p>
<p>the end result is that the web server</p>
<p>instances all access the same memory</p>
<p>allowing the clients connected to the</p>
<p>different servers to see those changes</p>
<p>in near real time too</p>
<p>there's a lot of functionality in our</p>
<p>product that uses cache data</p>
<p>for example streaming data from a stream</p>
<p>host or multiple stream hosts connecting</p>
<p>to application designer where the stream</p>
<p>hosts our clients as well</p>
<p>the main reason for scaling is</p>
<p>performance</p>
<p>for example if the CPU was high for data</p>
<p>streams and you had many streams running</p>
<p>you could scale up by increasing the app</p>
<p>service plan in Azure but there is a</p>
<p>limit to how high you can go</p>
<p>this is when you would scale up to get</p>
<p>more CPU</p>
<p>so one reason is for performance to</p>
<p>scale up and out</p>
<p>the second reason is resiliency</p>
<p>for example if you had data stream</p>
<p>designer on Azure app service plan 2 and</p>
<p>it had an issue with a performance was</p>
<p>deprecated for some reason users would</p>
<p>be locked out</p>
<p>however if you had two instances at a</p>
<p>lower service plan and one of those had</p>
<p>an issue that caused performance to be</p>
<p>degraded the users would be able to</p>
<p>continue to use the product on the</p>
<p>second instance</p>
<p>so resiliency is another Factor</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>the third benefit is cost</p>
<p>technically you can Auto scale out an</p>
<p>inner gain automatically or on a</p>
<p>schedule to better manage your</p>
<p>infrastructure costs in Peak periods</p>
<p>early benchmarking results indicate that</p>
<p>using distributed caching has</p>
<p>performance improvements even when you</p>
<p>are running only one instance of the</p>
<p>product and so is something you may want</p>
<p>to consider switching to for larger</p>
<p>production ready implementations</p>
<p>such as those with a large number of</p>
<p>data streams</p>
