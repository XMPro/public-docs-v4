<summary>Transcript</summary>
<p>welcome everybody um to today's webinar</p>
<p>um thank you for joining I'm Peter F</p>
<p>Scar and we'll talk about gen Ai and</p>
<p>digital twins in</p>
<p>2024 so with J AI uh</p>
<p>Steve hoft um Co actually reminded me of</p>
<p>this when you look at something like</p>
<p>geni and the impact of that um the the</p>
<p>what comes to mind is that it's almost</p>
<p>like magic so if you look at what's</p>
<p>what's happened over the last um year or</p>
<p>so in the space significant changes and</p>
<p>for me it's not so much um around the</p>
<p>the um the the the magic side of it it</p>
<p>is more the impact that it's got so and</p>
<p>it reminded me of the book uh who who</p>
<p>Moved My cheese where um it's all about</p>
<p>change and how we we adapt to new things</p>
<p>that are that are coming in so in that</p>
<p>story um when the cheese was moved the</p>
<p>the target the goal the the the</p>
<p>environment some like the the mice</p>
<p>adapted very well and some people didn't</p>
<p>um and yeah so this is kind of bringing</p>
<p>that um that thinking around what the</p>
<p>impact of digit of of generative AI is</p>
<p>and if you combine that with digital</p>
<p>Twins and how it's changing the</p>
<p>landscape the the changes that we see</p>
<p>especially in 2024 revolve around three</p>
<p>main areas the first one is we're seeing</p>
<p>a a a ground swell of challenges around</p>
<p>skills so lack of skills aging Workforce</p>
<p>in maturity and I'll drill down a little</p>
<p>bit on that but there's some significant</p>
<p>ific challenges ahead in terms of</p>
<p>getting people to work in manufacturing</p>
<p>likewise with the acceleration of of AI</p>
<p>and we've seen a lot of things like</p>
<p>co-pilots and and that happening last</p>
<p>year this year we'll see a lot of</p>
<p>experimentation moving to actual</p>
<p>implementations and adding value and</p>
<p>it's not just the novelty Factor anymore</p>
<p>but um the the the applications that</p>
<p>come out of it and lastly we also see</p>
<p>that the industry for. digitization</p>
<p>digitalization is picking up a lot of</p>
<p>momentum but is it really adding a lot</p>
<p>of value um and what we need to do in</p>
<p>terms of to boost productivity which is</p>
<p>a key challenge in the industry um we've</p>
<p>seen many of the developed countries are</p>
<p>either um stagnant or declining</p>
<p>productivity so how can we get more with</p>
<p>less people which is really what that</p>
<p>what that statement is about so those</p>
<p>three things is creating this perfect</p>
<p>storm for for how I believe um</p>
<p>generative AI will disrupt how we work</p>
<p>going forward if I look at the uh change</p>
<p>in Workforce in the next 10 years this</p>
<p>is from Gardner and I'll just summarize</p>
<p>it into those three into those three</p>
<p>things the workforce um is actually</p>
<p>growing slower than what the GDP is the</p>
<p>manufacturing Workforce is shrinking in</p>
<p>terms of real numbers so getting people</p>
<p>to come in and work in in manufacturing</p>
<p>and Associated Industries in the in the</p>
<p>industrial side is actually shrinking</p>
<p>and and one of the other statistics is</p>
<p>that one in four people in the next um</p>
<p>in the next 10 years in the next decade</p>
<p>will actually be over 65 that is still</p>
<p>in the workplace uh because of this lack</p>
<p>of skills now again looking at some of</p>
<p>the things that g is saying around what</p>
<p>are the type of jobs or tasks that we</p>
<p>can automate and the ones that are</p>
<p>ideally suited um to completely</p>
<p>digitalized you can see the bottom Green</p>
<p>in each of those production schedu and</p>
<p>quality so these are the type of tasks</p>
<p>that lend themselves to being um</p>
<p>automated to some degree and I'll touch</p>
<p>a little bit on how we at X and pro are</p>
<p>looking at at at that part of the</p>
<p>problem so I think generative AI um you</p>
<p>know people are saying well will this</p>
<p>replace jobs will that put people out of</p>
<p>work our real problem is we don't have</p>
<p>enough people to do the work that we</p>
<p>have there's a decline as I showed</p>
<p>previously but what was interesting Sam</p>
<p>Alman um CEO of open AI which also um</p>
<p>owns uh jgpt which is kind of</p>
<p>skyrocketed this whole thing uh made the</p>
<p>statement that AI tools are very good at</p>
<p>doing tasks but terrible at doing jobs</p>
<p>for now so the the focus of the AI tools</p>
<p>is not to replace jobs not to replace</p>
<p>people but to look at what of those</p>
<p>tasks that we can actually</p>
<p>automate um and and use the uh um</p>
<p>generative AI to be able to support us</p>
<p>in doing those tasks so we can get</p>
<p>people to do some of the other more</p>
<p>value added tasks so just on the if you</p>
<p>look at CH GPT and how quickly this is</p>
<p>on us and this is fascinating if you</p>
<p>look at how long it took Netflix to get</p>
<p>to to a million users and Facebook and</p>
<p>Instagram and and Chad GPT this is</p>
<p>phenomenal 180 million users and they</p>
<p>reckon there's about 100 million people</p>
<p>signing in every week um to use the</p>
<p>service so phenomenal with that if you</p>
<p>look at someone like Michael Dell who's</p>
<p>been around um the industry for a really</p>
<p>long time</p>
<p>um and he's seen many many waves what</p>
<p>he's saying is so far um there's nothing</p>
<p>that competes with what he's seeing on</p>
<p>this um on on what's happening with j</p>
<p>really interesting stat that I saw from</p>
<p>my Carol who's with um Georgia Pacific</p>
<p>um is you know how the productivity</p>
<p>which is really the output per hour how</p>
<p>that has changed over the last couple of</p>
<p>years you can see every time we had new</p>
<p>technology internet of things all of</p>
<p>that we get more for the labor that we</p>
<p>put in the challenge that we have is</p>
<p>this is gone completely flat um and his</p>
<p>point is that the more we put just</p>
<p>dashboards and and Analysis and</p>
<p>putting bi over um the information we've</p>
<p>not made any significant progress since</p>
<p>we've done that so what do we need to do</p>
<p>to get a step changed and it remind me</p>
<p>reminded me something or of the of the</p>
<p>great crisis in London New York and</p>
<p>places like that where they said in in</p>
<p>1894 that in 50 years London will be</p>
<p>buried under 9th fet of manure um and</p>
<p>there were conferences and a lot of</p>
<p>debate and what are we going to do</p>
<p>because we looked at the problem from</p>
<p>the horse perspective by 1912 Henry Ford</p>
<p>um got um the way that we make cars into</p>
<p>a repeatable process and since then that</p>
<p>problem has gone away so not within the</p>
<p>50 years but it completely changed and I</p>
<p>think gen AI is that complete change</p>
<p>that we seeing so this combination of</p>
<p>the three</p>
<p>trends that creates this this perfect</p>
<p>storm and if you combine this with</p>
<p>digital twins to shift towards digital</p>
<p>twins so Dr Michael Greaves um explained</p>
<p>you know what he sees as a intelligent</p>
<p>digital twin which compared to</p>
<p>traditional ways which is passive</p>
<p>offline goal given and predictive he</p>
<p>sees a digital twin which is active</p>
<p>always on agents real time goal seeking</p>
<p>versus and goal given and doing things</p>
<p>like front running simulations being</p>
<p>able to do that so it's not so to get</p>
<p>back to kind of the cheese and</p>
<p>analogy um it is not a better Mouse</p>
<p>straap it is a completely different way</p>
<p>that we have to think um so it's not</p>
<p>about the HSE manure problem it is about</p>
<p>how do we how do we change that whole</p>
<p>dynamic and address um the creating the</p>
<p>the vehicle change that we need so it's</p>
<p>not uh smarter repositories with more</p>
<p>data if you ask anyone they just want</p>
<p>more data it's not about um measuring</p>
<p>things like more kbis or building better</p>
<p>AI models or analytical models it's</p>
<p>about a whole shift and that's what we</p>
<p>are focusing on so our Focus um and how</p>
<p>I think geni will impact digital twins</p>
<p>is really in three area so how do we</p>
<p>generate twins so I call that generative</p>
<p>twins so how do I create a twin right</p>
<p>from getting the requirements designing</p>
<p>it building it testing it and putting it</p>
<p>in place the second part is how can I</p>
<p>make it smarter how can I put</p>
<p>intelligence into it because there's a</p>
<p>massive amount of information available</p>
<p>in large language models and you know</p>
<p>the the way that the that that g CH GPT</p>
<p>type applications are developing and the</p>
<p>information that sits in there billions</p>
<p>and billions of data points that it's</p>
<p>been trained on much better than any any</p>
<p>users how can we use that to provide</p>
<p>better co-pilots help with Advanced</p>
<p>analytics and decision making and things</p>
<p>like that so how do we not just build</p>
<p>but also create the intelligence and</p>
<p>then lastly how can we get them to do</p>
<p>some of these tasks and work for us so</p>
<p>we see this and um the term multi-agent</p>
<p>generative systems are being raised at</p>
<p>the moment by organizations like Gart</p>
<p>and other research it is very new um but</p>
<p>this is actually when you have multiple</p>
<p>autonomous agents that work together in</p>
<p>this goal-seeking</p>
<p>approach um but they have to work with</p>
<p>inside Rules of Engagement so I'll</p>
<p>quickly go into each of these and just</p>
<p>give you a view on what they are and</p>
<p>what we are doing as X and Pro in this</p>
<p>space so the first one is how do I</p>
<p>create um a digital twin and the the</p>
<p>reason that we see or the the benefit of</p>
<p>this is really quite often people are</p>
<p>stuck at how do I get started so we this</p>
<p>it helps you with with getting started</p>
<p>it helps you to collaborate around key</p>
<p>objectives that this that your solution</p>
<p>need to do and don't wander off around</p>
<p>one person's bias or a technology that's</p>
<p>really interesting it Focus around key</p>
<p>objectives it helps you build these</p>
<p>things a lot faster we anticipate around</p>
<p>about a 50% so we're still in testing</p>
<p>all of this but we anticipate around a</p>
<p>50% faster development overall um right</p>
<p>from requirements Gathering to get it</p>
<p>into into running and it helps you</p>
<p>sometimes to think out the box because</p>
<p>we are so trained and biased around you</p>
<p>know the world that we</p>
<p>know um that similar to what they had in</p>
<p>London New York and places like that</p>
<p>previously do is work in progress for us</p>
<p>so uh it you'll see this being released</p>
<p>throughout the course of the year um all</p>
<p>the things that I'll be sharing with you</p>
<p>so looking at this generator process we</p>
<p>broke it down into six steps so to get a</p>
<p>co-pilot to help us um defining the</p>
<p>requirements doing the data management</p>
<p>things like generative integration how</p>
<p>can I discover autodiscover apis and</p>
<p>actually build the mapping for me um</p>
<p>come up with what are the</p>
<p>recommendations that I that will help me</p>
<p>to identify the problem and and and and</p>
<p>um help me um provide prescriptive</p>
<p>analytics some ideas around what should</p>
<p>be on the ux how do I align that with</p>
<p>the user stories um and then actually</p>
<p>create the configuration actually create</p>
<p>the ex in our instance XM Pro Data</p>
<p>stream configuration files um and some</p>
<p>of the other IDE defacts that we need</p>
<p>the rec the recommendation files so that</p>
<p>those can be imported into the process</p>
<p>um and help you speed up</p>
<p>so uh and also gr documentation and then</p>
<p>lastly make sure that we can put</p>
<p>security and governance auditing use</p>
<p>this as an auditor to put that over this</p>
<p>as well so here's an</p>
<p>example um this is inside X and pro and</p>
<p>again I think this process is pretty</p>
<p>generic how we've implemented or how we</p>
<p>are implementing this is there are</p>
<p>multiple different use cases that you</p>
<p>see here you can see the five steps at</p>
<p>the Top If I choose one of them I can</p>
<p>then go into it there are the six</p>
<p>objectives and each of these will then</p>
<p>take me through a series of question</p>
<p>questions and um and prompts I can</p>
<p>prompt and it can prompt me back so if I</p>
<p>look at for example identifying key</p>
<p>objectives and</p>
<p>challenges so it'll start off by how do</p>
<p>you describe the business of problems</p>
<p>and so and there's a set of of questions</p>
<p>built on our methodology that we have</p>
<p>found very effective in working with</p>
<p>customers so how can we bring that and</p>
<p>make that available to anyone who's</p>
<p>trying to do this in this instance for</p>
<p>my cheese manufacturing organization you</p>
<p>can see a number of number of questions</p>
<p>and then at the end of it for step one</p>
<p>it'll start summarizing the results for</p>
<p>me so but that is learning so that I can</p>
<p>put this all together at the end and</p>
<p>actually create that configuration file</p>
<p>so and here are just some of the outputs</p>
<p>um of that so once that is done I can go</p>
<p>into the next um Step of this process so</p>
<p>being able to generate twins we</p>
<p>anticipate about a 50% reduction in time</p>
<p>and again this is new um you can help</p>
<p>you identify unanticipated needs it's</p>
<p>one of the benefits that we saw out of</p>
<p>it sometimes you don't think of it and</p>
<p>and uh the intelligence that's in this</p>
<p>agent allows you to to or will</p>
<p>interrogate will ask you questions which</p>
<p>you might not have thought of and the</p>
<p>real thing is that it can help you build</p>
<p>a digital twins around the real problem</p>
<p>statement here's an example of what came</p>
<p>out of a session like that where this is</p>
<p>the problem statement around the you</p>
<p>know what what where who why you know</p>
<p>what is the problem why you're doing it</p>
<p>how you going to do do this who is it</p>
<p>for and what are the key benefits it is</p>
<p>really good at taking all of those</p>
<p>questions from multiple inputs in</p>
<p>different stakeholders and helping you</p>
<p>to put this together so that is how we</p>
<p>build the twin the next part is how do</p>
<p>we put some intelligence into the twin</p>
<p>um how do we how do we um create smarter</p>
<p>twins so we don't just build them but</p>
<p>now we make them smarter and um I know</p>
<p>it's a Cheesy story but um I'll get back</p>
<p>to kind of the life of um</p>
<p>a day in the life of a cheese plant</p>
<p>operator who's assisted by co-pilot and</p>
<p>this co-pilot is really good as a</p>
<p>process advisor as you will see so</p>
<p>here's our stock standard dashboard for</p>
<p>a or digital twin um representation of a</p>
<p>um a cheddar manufacturing</p>
<p>um uh uh operation and you can see</p>
<p>across the top of the process I can see</p>
<p>different batches where they are what</p>
<p>the statuses oee all the normal things</p>
<p>that I that I like to see inside um my</p>
<p>normal application at the top right I</p>
<p>have an advisor if I click on that it</p>
<p>now opens up um a area where it will</p>
<p>actually look at what is currently there</p>
<p>what is what are the current um um uh</p>
<p>instances and what you'll see on the</p>
<p>recommendation side on the right hand</p>
<p>side out of the box X Andro allows you</p>
<p>to create recommendations with</p>
<p>recommendation rules and some of our</p>
<p>customers have actually got millions of</p>
<p>recommendations over three or four five</p>
<p>year period that they've gathered we can</p>
<p>interrogate this also with the digital</p>
<p>twin in this instance looking at the</p>
<p>process data um it can recommend what</p>
<p>queries you may want to run but I want</p>
<p>to and in this instance I'm asking it</p>
<p>what pasturization temperature and</p>
<p>duration yielded the best result in the</p>
<p>past so I'm looking for this golden</p>
<p>batch um in all my previous ones and see</p>
<p>if I so that I can that that I can build</p>
<p>a solution around or um a golden batch</p>
<p>approach so it will then interrogate the</p>
<p>data that is sitting inside our</p>
<p>application and this is um and it</p>
<p>provide me different ways of</p>
<p>demonstrating and showing that um</p>
<p>information whether I wanted graft or</p>
<p>and again this is all built into how I</p>
<p>can ask it certain questions around this</p>
<p>I may see that there's an issue with the</p>
<p>pasturization so you can see at the top</p>
<p>at the top there's a red box that um</p>
<p>shows me there's a there's an issue um</p>
<p>so that pops up and that's all part of</p>
<p>our standard recommendations you don't</p>
<p>have to do anything to get that</p>
<p>functionality there no AI involved in</p>
<p>that you can if you want uh put some AI</p>
<p>into the recommendations but those are</p>
<p>stock standard recommendations what I</p>
<p>tells me there's an issue with this</p>
<p>machine I can now go in and I can use</p>
<p>traditional AI where I do remaining</p>
<p>useful life and run regression models</p>
<p>and classification models and all those</p>
<p>things which is again standard in X</p>
<p>Andro you can get get that right now</p>
<p>there are some previous webinars that</p>
<p>discuss that in this instance um what</p>
<p>I'd like to do and having a trained on</p>
<p>our own company data our own operations</p>
<p>manuals our own recommendations uh I can</p>
<p>now start interrogating this so show me</p>
<p>that the temperature Trend around this</p>
<p>for the last 12 months and um with some</p>
<p>interpretations of what does it mean so</p>
<p>two instances were out of had anomalies</p>
<p>or whatever the case might be and then</p>
<p>um lastly show me this in a in a plot or</p>
<p>something these are all natural language</p>
<p>questions you can ask on your data at</p>
<p>any point in time so that's adding</p>
<p>intelligence to the digital twin now</p>
<p>just imagine so this is a water</p>
<p>treatment plant you can see there's a</p>
<p>camera with video on the side that</p>
<p>actually just imagine what it's like if</p>
<p>you could get the if you could get that</p>
<p>advisor to interpret what is actually</p>
<p>happening in that video and what does it</p>
<p>mean um so building that expertise at</p>
<p>becoming really really valuable assets</p>
<p>and workers in the organization it's not</p>
<p>just on the front end part of it but</p>
<p>expro has notebooks and we've had this</p>
<p>capability for a while where I plug in</p>
<p>ch GPT and I can do my analysis inside a</p>
<p>notebook which is where data scientists</p>
<p>engineers and people like that like to</p>
<p>take the expra data and and um and and</p>
<p>build models or evaluate or or or or</p>
<p>look for things and um in this instance</p>
<p>um I can ask it a question so</p>
<p>in Notebook using um exm Pro there's a</p>
<p>uh I can ask it how to how do I create a</p>
<p>correlation Matrix and again this is how</p>
<p>it creates the the python code for me I</p>
<p>can I run that then in the notebook and</p>
<p>here there's my visualization I didn't</p>
<p>have to know I don't know how to write</p>
<p>the the the code to actually create a</p>
<p>correlation Matrix um CH GPT did that</p>
<p>for me so that's the other area of a</p>
<p>co-pilot it's not just about your data</p>
<p>but also how to help you um um create</p>
<p>more intelligence or better questions so</p>
<p>again looking at this we see we</p>
<p>anticipate around about a 25%</p>
<p>productivity Improvement for people</p>
<p>using this we it's actually should</p>
<p>actually be more but um it also um help</p>
<p>you better decisions lower</p>
<p>cost better employees satisfaction and</p>
<p>it helps to create the self-service</p>
<p>analysis instead of going to an IT</p>
<p>organization and get them to write you a</p>
<p>SQL with a report that sits behind it so</p>
<p>that self that self-service analysis</p>
<p>really coming to the front the last part</p>
<p>is around how gen AI will impact digital</p>
<p>twins in 2024 is now it should do the</p>
<p>work not only do we create it we make it</p>
<p>smart but how can we get multi-agents to</p>
<p>do this now this is really um at the</p>
<p>Forefront of of where research and</p>
<p>everything is um it's a fascinating area</p>
<p>I personally believe this is the area</p>
<p>where there's most value because we're</p>
<p>taking the robot out of people and</p>
<p>making the world more human and that is</p>
<p>according to Leslie W Cox at London</p>
<p>School of Economics I love it um in</p>
<p>terms of what that approach means for XM</p>
<p>Pro we've seen that decision</p>
<p>intelligence is not just about</p>
<p>dashboards which is the support or the</p>
<p>decision augmentation which is kind of</p>
<p>bringing in these co-pilots but how can</p>
<p>we actually get in certain operating</p>
<p>conditions the the application to or the</p>
<p>the digital twin to run in a safe</p>
<p>operating environment for certain tasks</p>
<p>actually perform those tasks</p>
<p>autonomously in a lights out way and we</p>
<p>see this going from a informant approach</p>
<p>to a performant um solution going</p>
<p>forward so just imagine that cheese</p>
<p>factory again and in this cheese factory</p>
<p>I've got multiple agents now in a</p>
<p>traditional rule-based system I would</p>
<p>have to write all the rules with what</p>
<p>we're doing is the production agent the</p>
<p>process agent quality agent safety agent</p>
<p>have large language models behind them</p>
<p>so they are really smart around how to</p>
<p>interact how to plan and they have a lot</p>
<p>of knowledge around cheese they have a</p>
<p>lot of knowledge around safety and they</p>
<p>collaborate amongst each other in order</p>
<p>to achieve certain tasks now if you</p>
<p>expand that it's not just about the</p>
<p>production process but I could have the</p>
<p>same in the goods receiving packaging</p>
<p>and functional safety and I do need to</p>
<p>put some rules around it so these these</p>
<p>Bots or agents need to interact with</p>
<p>each other in that they virtual bots in</p>
<p>or or agents that interact with each</p>
<p>other in a collaborative way and they</p>
<p>use large language models as their way</p>
<p>of interacting and deciding what to do</p>
<p>next</p>
<p>um and and we then put the rules around</p>
<p>to say Within These in within these</p>
<p>rules you are allowed to interact with</p>
<p>each other and I'll get back to some of</p>
<p>what these what these</p>
<p>mean the this is how we see the</p>
<p>factories of the future where there's</p>
<p>certain tasks of this that can be done</p>
<p>and you know they can optimize a large</p>
<p>number of variables they're always on</p>
<p>goal seeking and they can reason like</p>
<p>humans in a</p>
<p>way this capability of machines being</p>
<p>able to manage more variables has been</p>
<p>proven by MIT at the machine</p>
<p>intelligence for manufacturing</p>
<p>operations side uh suggest that you have</p>
<p>a look at that but machines are much</p>
<p>better at optimizing a large number of</p>
<p>variables to what a human is there's</p>
<p>research done at places like standard</p>
<p>and Google Deep Mind and others around</p>
<p>this agent based approach how can agents</p>
<p>use large language models as their way</p>
<p>and we don't have to build all these</p>
<p>rules around them they can</p>
<p>discover um this is an example of and</p>
<p>these are real bots so this is a</p>
<p>physical what we are doing is the</p>
<p>virtual how do we build a digital twin</p>
<p>versions of this but these are eight</p>
<p>Bots that um interact with each other</p>
<p>they clean a room and</p>
<p>their focus is you know without having</p>
<p>procedural descriptions at the back but</p>
<p>using large language models on what I</p>
<p>should do what the task is how to break</p>
<p>it down how to actually perform it</p>
<p>fascinating stuff again if you're</p>
<p>interested have a look at Auto RT at</p>
<p>Google deep mine this is not what we're</p>
<p>doing we're doing this</p>
<p>around digital twins how can I create a</p>
<p>virtual approach that is similar to that</p>
<p>how can I get the digital twin to</p>
<p>actually run it instead of having robots</p>
<p>running around and what we've done at XM</p>
<p>Pro come up with a architecture which is</p>
<p>ideally suited to our stream hosts and</p>
<p>how we build applications right now so</p>
<p>we have data streams and stream hosts</p>
<p>and and the infrastructure that we can</p>
<p>plug these agents who can interact with</p>
<p>each other they can use exm Pro</p>
<p>listeners they can perceive in the</p>
<p>middle we have um the the actual we</p>
<p>train them on your company specific</p>
<p>domain knowledge um they have large</p>
<p>language models for their broader</p>
<p>understanding and there's reinforcement</p>
<p>learning to make sure that you know when</p>
<p>they reflect and plan that they that</p>
<p>they learn from what they do like we do</p>
<p>as humans like we do as when a new</p>
<p>person starts in our business it's</p>
<p>exactly the same process and then the</p>
<p>actions could be recommendation so</p>
<p>advising or we can actually um actuate</p>
<p>and switch things on and off um so</p>
<p>that's the that's the future this is</p>
<p>where we're heading and as I said X and</p>
<p>pro ideally suited to do this because we</p>
<p>already have the infrastructure event</p>
<p>based architecture so we are event</p>
<p>driven and we have data streams and data</p>
<p>and and a platform where we can plug</p>
<p>these things in</p>
<p>um this is all uh work from a the um</p>
<p>around the core of digital twins so we</p>
<p>have the digital twins we're building</p>
<p>the the generative agents to be able to</p>
<p>use the digital twins to interact and</p>
<p>and and um do this algorithmic business</p>
<p>and then what we're also doing is make</p>
<p>sure that we have the Rules of</p>
<p>Engagement in a computable way so the</p>
<p>agents can actually understand it so</p>
<p>what are the rules of engagement and</p>
<p>some of them may follow things like</p>
<p>deontic rules or more um so without</p>
<p>these rules you can't play it's the most</p>
<p>important part actually of this whole</p>
<p>thing is how do we make sure that it's</p>
<p>that we that we set that up and um the</p>
<p>way that we do that same same um outline</p>
<p>but it's the obligations prohibitions</p>
<p>permissions delegations all of those</p>
<p>kind of policies and how and how that</p>
<p>applies and how do we make it machine</p>
<p>readable and interpretable and enforced</p>
<p>by the multi-agent so again in the</p>
<p>multi-agent environment we're not trying</p>
<p>to automate not the job but the task so</p>
<p>let's say I've got two agents they need</p>
<p>to fill the milk tanks um they need to</p>
<p>consider power um milk levels</p>
<p>electricity prices maintenance schedules</p>
<p>production so between the operations</p>
<p>agent and the reliability agent they</p>
<p>need to negotiate they may have</p>
<p>competing objectives and they need to</p>
<p>need to negotiate around when to fall we</p>
<p>may then also later on introduce a</p>
<p>quality agent so again how do we</p>
<p>introduce this without procedural rules</p>
<p>that sit at the back um so that we can</p>
<p>address that challenge and XM Pro can</p>
<p>cover this whole Spectrum this whole</p>
<p>Continuum from one end to the other end</p>
<p>um starting with um where a lot of</p>
<p>organizations starts you don't have to</p>
<p>start at the right hand side start on</p>
<p>the left hand side and incrementally</p>
<p>increase and build the capability</p>
<p>towards that area where you can cover</p>
<p>the whole spectrum of what you need to</p>
<p>to support people to augment the</p>
<p>decisions and to take um so again in</p>
<p>terms of the impact of this is massive I</p>
<p>personally believe this is the biggest</p>
<p>thing we can do in this industry is to</p>
<p>help with that initial skills Gap and</p>
<p>the productivity challenge is to take</p>
<p>some of the T tasks that are repetitive</p>
<p>and don't add value um</p>
<p>to um and and and help address them by</p>
<p>helping to build helping to make it</p>
<p>smarter and helping to automate um the</p>
<p>whole process thank you very much um I</p>
<p>hope this has made sense um for us the</p>
<p>cheese hasn't moved we know where it is</p>
<p>um we are we we are going after it</p>
<p>unfortunately um we've run out of time</p>
<p>so there won't be time for questions um</p>
<p>but please contact me if you're</p>
<p>interested in exploring how we can help</p>
<p>you with this kind of problem and how</p>
<p>this could fit into your</p>
<p>organization um thank you very much</p>
<p>appreciate your time and look forward to</p>
<p>seeing you on a future</p>
<p>webinar</p>
