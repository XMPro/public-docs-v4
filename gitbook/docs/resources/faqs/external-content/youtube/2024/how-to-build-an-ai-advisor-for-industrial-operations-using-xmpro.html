<summary>Transcript</summary>
<p>good morning everybody and thank you for</p>
<p>joining me today so today what we're</p>
<p>going to do um in this webinar is run</p>
<p>through configuring an AI advisor using</p>
<p>data streams inside</p>
<p>XMR before we do that um and before we</p>
<p>jump in it'll be good for us just to get</p>
<p>an understanding of the the different</p>
<p>terminology that I'll be I'll be talking</p>
<p>to so what's the difference between a</p>
<p>assistant and a advisor those are the</p>
<p>key things that I'm looking to to run</p>
<p>through</p>
<p>here to do that um I'm going to break it</p>
<p>down from an aspect perspective we're</p>
<p>going to touch on assistant and advisor</p>
<p>uh side of things um as</p>
<p>well if we focus on the the aspect</p>
<p>pieces so breaking it down helps us to</p>
<p>compare the two of these things a little</p>
<p>bit easier so what is the focus of an</p>
<p>assist what's the focus of an advisor</p>
<p>what's their role approach some of the</p>
<p>benefits problem solving how do you</p>
<p>interact from a user perspective as well</p>
<p>as some of the value proposition uh</p>
<p>pieces as well so when we're talking</p>
<p>about an assistant its focus is</p>
<p>generally task and and operations um its</p>
<p>decision support capabilities are</p>
<p>immediate or</p>
<p>practical its expertise level is Broad</p>
<p>and general knowledge um so user</p>
<p>interactions generally direct or command</p>
<p>based um and and its main value</p>
<p>proposition why do you want an assistant</p>
<p>is efficiency and</p>
<p>convenience when we transition this to</p>
<p>an</p>
<p>advisor you'll notice that some of these</p>
<p>aspects start changing so again what's</p>
<p>the focus of an advisor is to give you</p>
<p>expertise and some strategy some of the</p>
<p>decision support there is high level and</p>
<p>complex one of the key benefits of a</p>
<p>advisor is strategic insights so we're</p>
<p>moving away from just increasing</p>
<p>productivity from an assistant to the</p>
<p>more insight side of things with an</p>
<p>advisor um the user interaction is a lot</p>
<p>more consultative so it's not so direct</p>
<p>or command based um it's more</p>
<p>interactive and you'll see the value</p>
<p>proposition right at the bottom there</p>
<p>when we start talking around an advisor</p>
<p>we're really talking around informed</p>
<p>decision making so an assistant is there</p>
<p>for efficiency and convenience uh when</p>
<p>we touch on an advisor we're looking a</p>
<p>lot more for informed decision making so</p>
<p>keep these in the back of the Mind as we</p>
<p>run through and and configure and look</p>
<p>at the different pieces of an AI visor</p>
<p>inside a and</p>
<p>BR if I break this down into so where</p>
<p>does this work with regards to uh what</p>
<p>we do at exent pop and there's</p>
<p>essentially three main areas of</p>
<p>decisions that can get made so you</p>
<p>generally start with decision support</p>
<p>that's your dashboards your your V by</p>
<p>condition monitoring typically Falls in</p>
<p>here if we looking at decision</p>
<p>augmentation this is where you are</p>
<p>reaching out and you're looking for</p>
<p>prescriptive recommendations augmented</p>
<p>information from an AI perspective or</p>
<p>from other systems uh Clos Loop feedback</p>
<p>Etc the last piece is around decision</p>
<p>automation where you have a human who is</p>
<p>not so much in the loop but on the loop</p>
<p>uh and keeping an eye on the automation</p>
<p>pieces um that are happening here the</p>
<p>current shift everyone is moving towards</p>
<p>decision</p>
<p>augmentation um and we see the future</p>
<p>shift moving towards decision automation</p>
<p>as</p>
<p>well so we're generally evolving and</p>
<p>moving from an informant to a performant</p>
<p>state from an XM Pro perspective we</p>
<p>cover the spectrum of all three so we go</p>
<p>from decision support to augmentation</p>
<p>all the way to decision automation um as</p>
<p>well what we're going to focus on today</p>
<p>though is we're just going to focus on</p>
<p>the decision augmentation piece this</p>
<p>piece in the middle over here um and and</p>
<p>how do we start bringing some of this AI</p>
<p>capability more specifically the AI</p>
<p>advisor pieces into this as</p>
<p>well how we see the the the AI and and</p>
<p>how it's working inside the operational</p>
<p>landscape is it's changing the landscape</p>
<p>but it's also helping um and move so</p>
<p>what do I mean by that so currently at</p>
<p>the moment uh you have automation so</p>
<p>deterministic workflow tasks you've also</p>
<p>got AI assistance so with the um chat</p>
<p>GPT um that's happened over the last</p>
<p>year and continuing into this year</p>
<p>everyone's very familiar with having a</p>
<p>conversation getting a response and</p>
<p>doing something that with that response</p>
<p>so AI assistant more freestyle chat side</p>
<p>of side of things as well um that</p>
<p>eventually if you remember the prior</p>
<p>visual that I had when we started</p>
<p>getting towards the more uh autonomous</p>
<p>on the far right you start moving into</p>
<p>the area of generative agents so how do</p>
<p>I have a goal-based single objective um</p>
<p>agent that will in turn move into how do</p>
<p>I have uh group goals so how do I have</p>
<p>an agent that looks off to specific</p>
<p>things and then how do I have a</p>
<p>supervisor role that actually helps</p>
<p>direct them from an agent perspective</p>
<p>and then the last piece is how do we get</p>
<p>to autonomous goal seing so</p>
<p>self-organizing um agents who don't</p>
<p>necessarily need a directed supervisory</p>
<p>role but can self-organize amongst</p>
<p>themselves and work out what they should</p>
<p>be doing and how they should be uh</p>
<p>interacting with the different systems</p>
<p>as</p>
<p>well you'll see on the far left here as</p>
<p>you increase your um automation</p>
<p>capabilities and your AI capabilities as</p>
<p>well you go up you start going into and</p>
<p>touching different areas of the outcome</p>
<p>pieces on the right here so when you</p>
<p>start looking at your task based genx</p>
<p>all the way up to uh self creating at</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>top how do we translate this into uh</p>
<p>what it is it that we do for industrial</p>
<p>operations so you'll see at the bottom I</p>
<p>still got the same items uh automation</p>
<p>assistant um I'll come to the advisor</p>
<p>agents and then multi-agent pieces as</p>
<p>well so I'll just build this up for it</p>
<p>so these are the different areas um that</p>
<p>you can actually interact with um inside</p>
<p>XM</p>
<p>Pro generic algorithms bring your own</p>
<p>models if you want to go towards the</p>
<p>more what we would call traditional AI</p>
<p>uh machine learning uh models and</p>
<p>algorithms um if you want to use some of</p>
<p>the notebooks we have done a prior</p>
<p>webinar on this as well so creating an</p>
<p>endtoend example</p>
<p>um using the accent Pro notebook so how</p>
<p>do I go from the one area all the way</p>
<p>through to to the other area um and make</p>
<p>use of the notebooks to to be able to do</p>
<p>that so that has been covered in a prior</p>
<p>webinar I encourage you to to go and</p>
<p>watch it if that is of Interest how do</p>
<p>you start bringing in some of the large</p>
<p>language pieces down here and this is</p>
<p>where we start transitioning into the AI</p>
<p>advisor pieces versus just an AI</p>
<p>assistant some of the other areas um</p>
<p>when we start talking around Ai and we</p>
<p>start talking around advisor is an</p>
<p>assistant the next thing that comes in</p>
<p>that is trying to do obviously rag or</p>
<p>retrieval augmented uh generation on top</p>
<p>of that so how can the advisors be a lot</p>
<p>smarter how can they be trained as</p>
<p>experts in what they are um to be able</p>
<p>to advise you correctly a key thing here</p>
<p>is also bringing your own llm model it's</p>
<p>one thing to be able to talk and go to a</p>
<p>chat GPT or anthropics clae but how can</p>
<p>you actually control the model that you</p>
<p>want to use and then on the far right</p>
<p>you'll see some of the agentic stuff um</p>
<p>we're not going to go into that as well</p>
<p>to today but just to give you a full</p>
<p>picture of all the different bits and</p>
<p>pieces from an exm Pro that you can</p>
<p>actually utilize uh for for your AI</p>
<p>Journey around industrial</p>
<p>operations before we jump into the</p>
<p>advisor if I just touch the AI assistant</p>
<p>so from an AI assistant perspective</p>
<p>there are a few different pieces in XM</p>
<p>Pro where you can use an assistant</p>
<p>the first is around</p>
<p>recommendations So currently the AI</p>
<p>assistant that you see here is in beta</p>
<p>um where you can have a discussion and</p>
<p>conversation with the assistant around</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>recommendations and what that will allow</p>
<p>you to do is to get some insights into</p>
<p>into the data as you triggered it um you</p>
<p>can ask it various questions it can</p>
<p>group sum it up um it can provide you</p>
<p>information from a graph perspective</p>
<p>that's tabular there's a lot of</p>
<p>different options in there but it is</p>
<p>just an assistant uh it just assists you</p>
<p>to find some of the information that</p>
<p>we're actually looking for the second</p>
<p>area where you can do that is inside</p>
<p>data streams now data streams are what</p>
<p>sits underneath everything that you're</p>
<p>looking at here there are data streams</p>
<p>behind the recommendations um that you</p>
<p>saw before so the AI assistant has data</p>
<p>stream sitting behind</p>
<p>it the data stream that you look at here</p>
<p>is using a open AI assistant agent now</p>
<p>what the open AI assistant agent does is</p>
<p>it allows you to interact and actually</p>
<p>talk to an assistant that you have</p>
<p>defined inside um open ai's uh</p>
<p>playground again what you can do there</p>
<p>is you can configure a specific set of</p>
<p>prompts you can spe create a specific</p>
<p>set of tools that it has access to and</p>
<p>then you can call it the challenge with</p>
<p>that though is you don't really have a</p>
<p>lot of control over fine-tuning the</p>
<p>prompt outside of that environment so</p>
<p>outside of that environment you have to</p>
<p>just use what was published which means</p>
<p>if you don't have access you can't</p>
<p>adjust the prompt you can't adjust the</p>
<p>model you're looking at you can't adjust</p>
<p>any of the parameters if that is your</p>
<p>use case and you don't need to then by</p>
<p>all means you can just drag the</p>
<p>component in from the toolbox and</p>
<p>actually just use it to talk to um the</p>
<p>open AI assistant from a cloud</p>
<p>perspective</p>
<p>there when we start getting to the</p>
<p>advisor</p>
<p>though there's a few elements U that we</p>
<p>are configured to bring this to uh to</p>
<p>life so to speak I'll run through them</p>
<p>here and then I'll actually take you</p>
<p>into an example for them as well so the</p>
<p>first is the result so where do you see</p>
<p>the AI ADV visor pieces um where can an</p>
<p>end user interact with them and how do</p>
<p>they visualize and see some of the data</p>
<p>for that as well the second piece is how</p>
<p>can you change and Define edit some of</p>
<p>the prompts that you're looking at you</p>
<p>want to be able to have fine grain</p>
<p>control over which model you're running</p>
<p>what are your prompts how can you change</p>
<p>them how can you shape them um as we're</p>
<p>going on the uh the AI Journey here and</p>
<p>interacting with large language models</p>
<p>prompting is one of the key elements to</p>
<p>make sure am I getting the right</p>
<p>information out that's relevant to what</p>
<p>I'm asking or is it just going to start</p>
<p>giving me incorrect information and</p>
<p>hallucinating the the other benefit of</p>
<p>creating advisor is you can create these</p>
<p>what we call experts in specific areas</p>
<p>so I can have an expert in rotating</p>
<p>equipment I can have an expert in</p>
<p>quality I can have an expert in safety</p>
<p>which means by narrowing their U scope</p>
<p>by narrowing their task Focus you help</p>
<p>to minimize a lot of the hallucinations</p>
<p>um that they can have as well if you</p>
<p>keep it too generic and too broad what</p>
<p>you will find is they will start</p>
<p>hallucinating just like we do um and the</p>
<p>results are not going to be what you're</p>
<p>expecting the third element to this is</p>
<p>we're actually using</p>
<p>recommendations so we created a generic</p>
<p>recommendation that we are tying to the</p>
<p>data streams that allow me to push it</p>
<p>and make it available to the first</p>
<p>screen that you saw here which was the</p>
<p>actual um an app and last but what by</p>
<p>definitely means uh most important piece</p>
<p>here is how do I actually create this so</p>
<p>data stream underpin everything that</p>
<p>we're looking at so that is the</p>
<p>information of where I get my data run</p>
<p>my models and actually present it to the</p>
<p>end users on the other side so let's</p>
<p>jump into an example and configure what</p>
<p>I'm looking at over here so the first</p>
<p>piece of the puzzle is let's have a look</p>
<p>at the data stream and then I'll work</p>
<p>backwards from</p>
<p>there when you look at this particular</p>
<p>data stream I'll draw your attention</p>
<p>right down here to the actual um the AI</p>
<p>piece and what it's actually doing so</p>
<p>this stream when it's running is getting</p>
<p>data coming from an endpoint now again</p>
<p>this endpoint can be anything there are</p>
<p>a lot of different listeners in here</p>
<p>from a library perspective so all you</p>
<p>have to do is drag it on if you don't</p>
<p>want to use mqt you want to use opcua or</p>
<p>a historian by all means you can do that</p>
<p>as well you'll see we're getting the</p>
<p>prompt details in here so we're reading</p>
<p>the prompt details from a data source</p>
<p>this is coming out of SQL can it come</p>
<p>out of a graph database yes can to come</p>
<p>out of another system yes you want to</p>
<p>store your prompts in CSV flat files and</p>
<p>read that in you can do that as well the</p>
<p>key piece here is you want to be able to</p>
<p>have a generic mechanism to get your</p>
<p>prompt Details</p>
<p>In The Stream here is also using</p>
<p>recommendation so if I have triggered a</p>
<p>recommendation for this particular asset</p>
<p>do I want to re-trigger one or do I want</p>
<p>to even pass the information to the</p>
<p>model and have it run no I don't the key</p>
<p>thing to remember here</p>
<p>is you don't want to push every single</p>
<p>thing through at a speed of you know</p>
<p>every 1 second to a model because models</p>
<p>do take some time to run if you are</p>
<p>running this model in the cloud and you</p>
<p>want to get the per second you can</p>
<p>achieve that yes it's going to be costly</p>
<p>if you want to run this model U locally</p>
<p>again you can achieve that but it's</p>
<p>going to be costly in infrastructure</p>
<p>costs the reality of the use case here</p>
<p>is to work out under what condition do I</p>
<p>actually want to pass this information</p>
<p>to an advisor and get a response back so</p>
<p>what you'll see here is we've actually</p>
<p>got a filter that says if there's radio</p>
<p>recommendation for this asset that was</p>
<p>triggered by this AI advisor we actually</p>
<p>don't want to pass anything to the model</p>
<p>we just ignore it because there's</p>
<p>already a recommendation um that's been</p>
<p>triggered if a recommendation has not</p>
<p>been triggered then we're going to pass</p>
<p>it to the actual model that we're</p>
<p>looking at here it's going to evaluate</p>
<p>what we're giving it and it's going to</p>
<p>give us the information and we are then</p>
<p>going to run a recommendation and update</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>recommendation if I double click any of</p>
<p>these there's nothing weirdly</p>
<p>complicated about this the actual</p>
<p>configuration will just walk you through</p>
<p>what you're actually looking at here</p>
<p>it's the exact same data streams uh for</p>
<p>those who have used these in the past</p>
<p>that you are familiar with all that</p>
<p>we've got access to here is a new agent</p>
<p>in the machine learning side of things</p>
<p>so you'll see here is an AER open AI</p>
<p>I'll scroll a bit further down here is</p>
<p>aama Agent there is the open AI</p>
<p>assistant so all there are are new</p>
<p>agents in the actual library that you</p>
<p>can just use in the same way that you</p>
<p>are used to um in the</p>
<p>past if I double click the SQL that I've</p>
<p>got here you can see we're looking at</p>
<p>the prompt if I double click this here</p>
<p>this is actually pointing to a local</p>
<p>model you have a few different options</p>
<p>when it comes to U how do I want to</p>
<p>configure an AI advisor as I mentioned</p>
<p>earlier I can go and push this to an AI</p>
<p>assistant um in open AI who you can</p>
<p>train as an expert get the results that</p>
<p>come back and then add all the different</p>
<p>other recommendations um around that and</p>
<p>then you can get a AI advisor piece</p>
<p>coming out of that the challenge with</p>
<p>talking to to the cloud ones is there is</p>
<p>a cost around the</p>
<p>tokens so it does not matter how many</p>
<p>tokens you send there is a cost to</p>
<p>compute that and get the results for</p>
<p>that to come back the other option is</p>
<p>you can run models locally so this is</p>
<p>actually running locally in uh the lab</p>
<p>that I have set up here and I can pass</p>
<p>the URL on the model in dynamically I</p>
<p>can also pass all the um system prompt</p>
<p>and the user prompts in dynamically as</p>
<p>well if I want to change out it's</p>
<p>actually pretty quick and easy for me to</p>
<p>do that if I want to adjust for instance</p>
<p>model temperature um I can adjust that</p>
<p>as</p>
<p>well when the stream is</p>
<p>running the Telemetry details coming in</p>
<p>here we'll send our information through</p>
<p>what you'll notice here is I have a</p>
<p>pre-filter so what I'm looking for is</p>
<p>I'm only looking for assets that have</p>
<p>gone above over and above or below</p>
<p>certain thresholds that I've to find I</p>
<p>don't want to use the llm to actually</p>
<p>filter out noise I actually want to</p>
<p>filter out the noise before I get to</p>
<p>should I pass this to a um large</p>
<p>language model for it to evaluate</p>
<p>further um otherwise you're are going to</p>
<p>just be wasting resources down here and</p>
<p>passing it noise and hoping it figures</p>
<p>out some of the pieces as well can you</p>
<p>do that you can again you're going to</p>
<p>have to take into account token costs if</p>
<p>this is going into the cloud or you're</p>
<p>going to have to take into account</p>
<p>compute costs from a infrastructure</p>
<p>perspective locally if you're running a</p>
<p>local one</p>
<p>so this is what sits underneath the hood</p>
<p>data is coming in we are getting some</p>
<p>prompts we're also using the</p>
<p>recommendations to help weed out before</p>
<p>we get to run the actual model</p>
<p>itself the result where do I actually</p>
<p>see the result of of this if I look at a</p>
<p>particular app that I've got over here</p>
<p>it's the same app that we used to and</p>
<p>and have been looking at in the past on</p>
<p>the right you'll see here are the</p>
<p>recommendations if I click the top</p>
<p>recommend Commendation this will open up</p>
<p>a recommendation that was triggered by</p>
<p>the AI advisor so this is the result of</p>
<p>that data stream that I'm looking at</p>
<p>here you'll see in the middle piece here</p>
<p>AI response this is what the actual</p>
<p>large language model gave me when it ran</p>
<p>through this particular data stream and</p>
<p>triggered a recommendation</p>
<p>here so again this is how an end user</p>
<p>can interact with it if we go back one</p>
<p>more step so I've got a data</p>
<p>stream the data stream was actually</p>
<p>triggering a</p>
<p>recommendation so if we go into well</p>
<p>what does that recommendation look like</p>
<p>exactly the same as you're used to we</p>
<p>have our recommendations you will see</p>
<p>they are configured and set to a</p>
<p>particular data stream so it's exactly</p>
<p>the same data stream that we are looking</p>
<p>at</p>
<p>here and we have created a generic um</p>
<p>recommendation for it you still got</p>
<p>access to all the detail and value so I</p>
<p>can be a lot more specific in the</p>
<p>headline and descriptions with the data</p>
<p>that is passing through the data stream</p>
<p>as well so exactly the same behavior you</p>
<p>used to when you're configuring</p>
<p>recommendations for other use cases this</p>
<p>is just using it from a generic</p>
<p>perspective to create an AI advisor that</p>
<p>I can use on the apps</p>
<p>themselves if we go back to the</p>
<p>app this is a recommendation if I go</p>
<p>back one you will see it'll take me back</p>
<p>to the um application itself and I've</p>
<p>got access to all my other</p>
<p>recommendations now for those who are</p>
<p>familiar with some recommendations this</p>
<p>may look a little bit</p>
<p>different this is a recommendation uh</p>
<p>with a different template that was</p>
<p>applied to it you can still use the</p>
<p>prior recommendations and if that is um</p>
<p>where you want to put all of this but</p>
<p>you don't have to you can adjust the</p>
<p>visuals to other types of visualizations</p>
<p>for the same set of data so here I still</p>
<p>have my event data as you used to I'll</p>
<p>scroll a bit further down I'll still</p>
<p>have my analytics I can still have my</p>
<p>notes coming in here as well across the</p>
<p>top you can assign it false positive or</p>
<p>resolve the recommendation as well so</p>
<p>exactly the same capability present it a</p>
<p>little bit</p>
<p>differently this is the recommendation</p>
<p>that triggered for it if we go back to</p>
<p>the stream that gets used down</p>
<p>here the recommendation that is</p>
<p>triggered gets read in here which stops</p>
<p>me from talking to the model too many</p>
<p>times let's have a look at the prompt</p>
<p>over here though so if I have a look at</p>
<p>the prompt you'll see it's coming from</p>
<p>SQL there is a actual application that</p>
<p>you can configure um on top of that as</p>
<p>well if you already have a prompt</p>
<p>Library um and you just want to read</p>
<p>that in we can do that as well this one</p>
<p>pretty simple and straightforward what</p>
<p>model am I looking to run what's my</p>
<p>model temperature what is my system</p>
<p>context for that and my user</p>
<p>context system context defines that you</p>
<p>are an expert in whatever for this</p>
<p>example it's rotating equipment so he's</p>
<p>an expert in the pump efficiency and</p>
<p>optimization you can create an expert as</p>
<p>I mentioned earlier from a safety</p>
<p>perspective from a quality perspective</p>
<p>maybe there's some static equipment or</p>
<p>different types of rotating equipment</p>
<p>you can also create an expert in the</p>
<p>process flow so let's take a</p>
<p>manufacturing example you can create an</p>
<p>expert</p>
<p>and the actual flow all the way from</p>
<p>start of manufacturing to the end of</p>
<p>manufacturing as well user content is as</p>
<p>you are used to when you are creating</p>
<p>your own uh conversations with your gpts</p>
<p>uh which pieces do we actually want to</p>
<p>plug</p>
<p>in when we are running this through the</p>
<p>Stream So when we say user content here</p>
<p>what we're actually meaning is in this</p>
<p>instance the user content will actually</p>
<p>be coming from whatever source of data</p>
<p>it is there's no actual user um as a</p>
<p>human that is sitting and talking to</p>
<p>this your machines are actually talking</p>
<p>to it in this example can this read from</p>
<p>a human yes it can if you want to</p>
<p>actually expand the um AI assistant that</p>
<p>I mentioned earlier with the</p>
<p>recommendations and actually have a</p>
<p>human ask similar questions you can do</p>
<p>that as</p>
<p>well so we're getting in the prompt</p>
<p>details and if you have a look at how</p>
<p>they have been defined II assistant with</p>
<p>an expertise what is your top askask</p>
<p>that you are looking to do and what</p>
<p>should you be</p>
<p>considering depending on which model I</p>
<p>want to talk to I may want to change and</p>
<p>tune my system prompts I might want to</p>
<p>change and tune my user prompts I can do</p>
<p>that quite easily over here save the</p>
<p>changes and whatever the interval is</p>
<p>that we've defined here so if I go back</p>
<p>in here and have a look every five uh</p>
<p>minutes it will get the new prompt if I</p>
<p>want to change this and say you know</p>
<p>what I'm actually trying to split test</p>
<p>some prompts I can change that to every</p>
<p>5 Seconds as an example which means if I</p>
<p>save my new prompt details away I just</p>
<p>need to wait 5 seconds and then it'll</p>
<p>load in the the new prompts and I can</p>
<p>then evaluate that I don't need to stop</p>
<p>and start a stream I don't need to stop</p>
<p>and start and publish anything I can use</p>
<p>an interface like this just to update</p>
<p>and change what I'm looking at the</p>
<p>benefit of running</p>
<p>a uh a local offline um Repository like</p>
<p>olama is I could have one prompt that is</p>
<p>using an olama you'll see I have another</p>
<p>prompt here using SQL coder as a model</p>
<p>Etc so I can have different models</p>
<p>running for different types of assets</p>
<p>for different use cases all running</p>
<p>within the same structure that I've got</p>
<p>defined</p>
<p>here so this is the prompt that is</p>
<p>sitting behind and it's being fed into</p>
<p>the data stream this is the</p>
<p>recommendation that we've configured and</p>
<p>set up that I can interact with and from</p>
<p>an end user this is how they can consume</p>
<p>and react to the responses coming in now</p>
<p>some key things here is it's always good</p>
<p>to make sure that you have a mechanism</p>
<p>to give feedback to the model as well is</p>
<p>this a good response or a bad response</p>
<p>um for it so it can also help learn that</p>
<p>the next time it runs through it takes</p>
<p>that into account as</p>
<p>well if I'm looking at this and I</p>
<p>actually want to have a conversation to</p>
<p>it can I do that as well yes you can</p>
<p>you'll see on the right here I can start</p>
<p>having a conversation and it can take</p>
<p>into account this response it can take</p>
<p>into account the event data</p>
<p>and and my horrible spelling as well so</p>
<p>information in the middle how we got</p>
<p>that that we got that through the data</p>
<p>stream triggering that recommendation</p>
<p>there this model was actually coming off</p>
<p>of a local</p>
<p>model where over here as this is running</p>
<p>this is actually talking to a um chat</p>
<p>GPT I think this is running chat for all</p>
<p>and I can have conversations with it</p>
<p>with different data again prompts as you</p>
<p>can move these around the data as you</p>
<p>can move them around all we're doing</p>
<p>here is we're just putting the different</p>
<p>pieces together</p>
<p>around a use case um that we call as a</p>
<p>an AI advisor on the data that is coming</p>
<p>in some of the information that you</p>
<p>looking at in here as well you can see</p>
<p>some of the citations coming in as well</p>
<p>so again grounded in where's my</p>
<p>information coming from so that I can</p>
<p>trust the data as</p>
<p>well so what do we just go through from</p>
<p>an AI visor perspective there's a few</p>
<p>different elements to to consider here</p>
<p>the first is the</p>
<p>visual where can I consume the data can</p>
<p>we pass this AI response to other</p>
<p>systems yes we can this is just an</p>
<p>example inside X Ando we can pass this</p>
<p>to any Downstream system uh that</p>
<p>requires it needs it or once</p>
<p>it the next piece is the actual prompts</p>
<p>themselves how do I create the prompts</p>
<p>change prompts maybe I want to do some</p>
<p>prompt chaining in here how do I tune</p>
<p>the prompts for the situation ation that</p>
<p>I'm creating or want to uh help</p>
<p>manage if we go one step further the</p>
<p>generic recommendation so here we're</p>
<p>just using our recommendation engine and</p>
<p>creating a generic recommendation for</p>
<p>the AI side can you be more specific and</p>
<p>actually create recommendations for</p>
<p>specific asset classes yes you can can</p>
<p>you hook this into existing data streams</p>
<p>that you may have to finded you can do</p>
<p>that as well this does not have to stand</p>
<p>on its</p>
<p>it fits in with everything that you used</p>
<p>to um and have configured up to now as</p>
<p>well and then the last is the data</p>
<p>Stream So what sits behind this what is</p>
<p>actually consuming the data bringing the</p>
<p>prompts in Reading recommendations</p>
<p>passing it to the model getting the</p>
<p>result and then passing that to the</p>
<p>um the recommendation so that they can</p>
<p>be triggered as well the last side I'll</p>
<p>leave you with is again what are all the</p>
<p>different pieces when it comes to to the</p>
<p>AI side of things for industrial</p>
<p>operations there's generic</p>
<p>algorithms you can bring your own model</p>
<p>if you want to do just simple regression</p>
<p>Etc there is notebook capability and as</p>
<p>I mentioned earlier there is a webinar</p>
<p>that we have done previously which will</p>
<p>walk you end to end through that as</p>
<p>well this is where we start getting into</p>
<p>some of the large language models so</p>
<p>there are agents for for</p>
<p>instance um o llama to run it locally</p>
<p>there are some to run open AI um and</p>
<p>that library is expanding as more models</p>
<p>become available on the far right when</p>
<p>we start dealing with the advisor side</p>
<p>of things how do we do that on top of</p>
<p>xmo recommendations how do we also start</p>
<p>doing that on top of your own</p>
<p>documentation as well so how can we</p>
<p>perform rag which again is retrieval</p>
<p>augmented generation on top of your own</p>
<p>data so we want to use your own data</p>
<p>your own manuals Etc as part of that</p>
<p>advisory uh</p>
<p>capability and then bring your own model</p>
<p>maybe you've defined your own model and</p>
<p>you don't want to use one of the</p>
<p>available ones out there you can bring</p>
<p>that in as well and just some of the</p>
<p>other future work that we are working on</p>
<p>right now is around the agent side of</p>
<p>things so how do you create a generative</p>
<p>agent a directive agent and also moving</p>
<p>towards multi-agent systems where they</p>
<p>are self-organizing as</p>
<p>well and with that I thank you for the</p>
<p>uh for the time today thank you for</p>
<p>listening to today's webinar I hope you</p>
<p>have a great rest of uh rest of the day</p>
<p>and we'll see you again on one of our</p>
<p>future webinars thank you</p>
