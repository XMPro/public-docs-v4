<p>hi and Welcome to our technical deep</p>
<p>dive on XM Pro stream hosts and</p>
<p>collections in this video we'll explore</p>
<p>how these powerful tools enable scalable</p>
<p>real-time data processing whether you're</p>
<p>managing a few assets or thousands</p>
<p>stream hosts and collections provide the</p>
<p>flexibility efficiency and scalability</p>
<p>needed to handle complex data</p>
<p>orchestration tasks let's get started</p>
<p>and see how XM Pro can transform your</p>
<p>DOA</p>
<p>operations when building intelligent</p>
<p>business operations Solutions it's easy</p>
<p>to focus solely on the user interface</p>
<p>however this overlooks The crucial</p>
<p>components that power and drive the</p>
<p>solution behind the scenes data streams</p>
<p>stream hosts and collections are the</p>
<p>hidden yet essential elements of XM Pro</p>
<p>ensuring your intelligent operation</p>
<p>Solutions are robust and</p>
<p>scalable the data stream designer is a</p>
<p>canvas where we map out real-time data</p>
<p>flows for specific use cases it allows</p>
<p>users to integrate transform orchestrate</p>
<p>and sanitize data within a single</p>
<p>cohesive data workflow with over 100</p>
<p>Integrations 75 plus analytics agents</p>
<p>and 60 plus action agents it empowers</p>
<p>you to derive meaningful insights</p>
<p>predict future Trends and automate</p>
<p>responses</p>
<p>seamlessly underpinning our data streams</p>
<p>are stream hosts which are responsible</p>
<p>for executing the logic of the data</p>
<p>streams configured in the data stream</p>
<p>designer when you configure a data</p>
<p>stream and hit publish a stream host</p>
<p>takes over to run it the number and</p>
<p>location of stream host depend on your</p>
<p>us case for centralized operations you</p>
<p>might use a single stream host for</p>
<p>localized operations stream hosts can be</p>
<p>deploy as close to assets as required</p>
<p>ensuring real-time data processing right</p>
<p>where it's needed stream hosts run the</p>
<p>data streams designed in the data string</p>
<p>designer executing the logic and</p>
<p>processes you have configured they</p>
<p>enable the agent library to communicate</p>
<p>with various entities including assets</p>
<p>line of business applications and other</p>
<p>systems let's jump into an example to</p>
<p>consider this scalability of string</p>
<p>hosts imagine you're monitoring the</p>
<p>temperature of an asset the data stream</p>
<p>collects temperature data filters for</p>
<p>values above a certain threshold and</p>
<p>then creates a work order in for example</p>
<p>sap at the bottom we have one asset with</p>
<p>compute capability next to it and we</p>
<p>have a Stream post deployed on it this</p>
<p>Computing capability could be a Windows</p>
<p>server or a Linux based system there are</p>
<p>multiple options available to us here</p>
<p>currently this stream host is running</p>
<p>for only one asset but what happens when</p>
<p>we have multiple</p>
<p>assets this is where collections come in</p>
<p>a collection is a container that enables</p>
<p>a grouping of stream posts running the</p>
<p>same use cases a collection allows us to</p>
<p>deploy one data stream to multiple</p>
<p>stream posts running the same use case</p>
<p>automatically by doing this a single</p>
<p>data stream can be published to one</p>
<p>collection and the stream posts by self</p>
<p>subscribing to the collection download</p>
<p>and then run the data stream logic</p>
<p>next let's touch on collection variables</p>
<p>collection variables are common to all</p>
<p>stream hosts that subscribe to a</p>
<p>collection each stream host defines a</p>
<p>value for these variables</p>
<p>locally this setup enables the same data</p>
<p>stream to be deployed to different</p>
<p>stream posts but the connection details</p>
<p>it requires can be unique per Stream</p>
<p>post for example if you have a data</p>
<p>stream that requires specific</p>
<p>configuration settings such as IP</p>
<p>addresses port numbers or authentication</p>
<p>credentials collection variables allow</p>
<p>each Stream post to use its own local</p>
<p>values for these</p>
<p>settings this means that while the logic</p>
<p>of the data stream remains consistent</p>
<p>across all stream posts the specific</p>
<p>interactions and connections can be</p>
<p>tailored to the unique requirements of</p>
<p>each Stream</p>
<p>post now that we have discussed the</p>
<p>various aspects of stream hosts and</p>
<p>collections let's conclude with a few</p>
<p>examples of how this is deployed in</p>
<p>practice in this example you have</p>
<p>multiple assets communicating with a</p>
<p>single stream host which then drives the</p>
<p>actions various assets can send data to</p>
<p>a central OBC server which can be</p>
<p>intercepted and managed by a single</p>
<p>Stream post this setup works well for</p>
<p>centralized data management and action</p>
<p>execution alternatively you can create a</p>
<p>different topology where each plant has</p>
<p>its own stream host these individual</p>
<p>stream hosts can send data to a central</p>
<p>cloud-based stream host which further</p>
<p>processes and integrates the</p>
<p>information this decentralized approach</p>
<p>allows for low localized data processing</p>
<p>and better management of specific plant</p>
<p>operations you can also have a</p>
<p>configuration where each stream host</p>
<p>runs different data streams such as LPC</p>
<p>mqt or others and sends the processed</p>
<p>data to a Central</p>
<p>Area this setup ensures that each data</p>
<p>stream is managed efficiently according</p>
<p>to its specific protocol and</p>
<p>requirements finally there's an option</p>
<p>to run one Stream post per asset</p>
<p>assuming you have sufficient compute</p>
<p>capability next to each asset asset when</p>
<p>it comes to scalability these different</p>
<p>topologies whether running stream posts</p>
<p>next to assets using a historian or</p>
<p>leveraging cloud-based servers allow you</p>
<p>to optimize data processing according to</p>
<p>your operational needs you can even have</p>
<p>distributed streams or parts of a data</p>
<p>Stream Run on different stream hosts</p>
<p>though this requires careful</p>
<p>consideration of latency and other</p>
<p>factors now let's conclude by addressing</p>
<p>some frequently asked questions if you</p>
<p>have any more questions please reach out</p>
<p>to the accent pro team</p>
<p>and one of our solution Engineers would</p>
<p>be happy to assist you</p>
